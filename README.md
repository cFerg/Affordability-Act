# Affordability Act — Website & Docs

Live site: https://affordact.com  
Repo: https://github.com/cFerg/Affordability-Act

## What this is
This repo hosts a public, version-controlled copy of the Affordability Act text and the website that renders it.

## How to read
- **Full bill**: `/policy/bill-text/`
- **Individual sections**: `/policy/sections/<name>.md` → browsable on the website

## How to contribute
- **Best**: Open a GitHub **Issue** with your suggestion/correction:  
  https://github.com/cFerg/Affordability-Act/issues/new/choose
- **Discussion**: https://github.com/cFerg/Affordability-Act/discussions
- **No GitHub?** Use the form: https://affordact.com/submit/

> Please avoid editing the compiled `policy/bill-text.md` directly — it’s generated. Edit files under `policy/sections/` instead.

## What __NOT__ to touch
- `policy/bill-text.md` (Generated via Build_Docs.py)
- `.github/workflows` (Unless you know CI)
- `assets/favicon.*`, `assets/icon-*.png`, `assets/site.webmanifest` (Auto-Rendered via SVGs)

## Local preview (optional)
You can run the site locally to check layout or content changes before pushing.

1. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) — or open this repo in **GitHub Codespaces** (which already has them).
2. In your terminal, run the following:
```cmd
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
3. This will build the site and serve it locally.
4. Open the preview in your browser at **http://127.0.0.1:4000**
5. Edit files under `policy/sections/`, then refresh the page to see updates.
