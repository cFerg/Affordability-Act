-->

# 🏠 Housing & Land  
## Section 1 — Ownership, Property Rights & Limits

## Plain-English Summary  
Ownership of property grants strong rights, but not immunity from laws that protect the public, neighbors, or fair access to housing and land. This section guarantees meaningful ownership while preventing hoarding, neglect, and exploitation that undermine affordability and community stability.

---

## Legal-Style Provisions

### 1.1 Ownership Rights Guaranteed (Not Absolute)

**1.1.1 Core Ownership Rights**  
Lawful owners of property are guaranteed:
- exclusive possession,
- the right to sell, lease, or occupy,
- the right to improve or modify property subject to safety codes.

**1.1.2 No-Immunity Clause**  
Ownership does not exempt any person or entity from:
- blight enforcement,
- safety standards,
- valuation limits under this Act,
- anti-hoarding or market participation rules.

Ownership may not be invoked to defeat enforcement of affordability, safety, or public welfare protections.

---

### 1.2 Anti-Hoarding & Accumulation Limits

**1.2.1 Purpose Limitation**  
Property may not be accumulated primarily for:
- speculative resale,
- artificial scarcity,
- value inflation without productive use.

**1.2.2 Scaled Ownership Review**  
Entities or individuals holding multiple residential properties may be subject to:
- enhanced reporting,
- valuation caps,
- use-or-release requirements.

Primary residences are exempt from accumulation penalties.

---

### 1.3 Trusts, Inheritance & Beneficial Ownership

**1.3.1 Trust Transparency**  
Property held in trust must disclose:
- beneficial owner(s),
- occupancy status,
- maintenance responsibility.

Trust structures may not be used to evade valuation, upkeep, or market participation rules.

**1.3.2 Inherited Property Protections**  
Inherited property is protected from forced sale provided:
- base valuation limits are respected, and
- minimum upkeep standards are met.

Minor beneficiaries are granted extended compliance periods with no penalty accrual.

---

### 1.4 Corporate & Foreign Ownership Rules

**1.4.1 Equal Applicability**  
All provisions of this Act apply equally to:
- individuals,
- corporations,
- investment entities,
- foreign owners.

No entity is exempt by virtue of residence, citizenship, or incorporation location.

**1.4.2 Use-It-or-Release Requirement**  
Residential property held vacant beyond defined thresholds may be subject to:
- compulsory listing,
- public acquisition at regulated value,
- or mandated productive use.

---

### 1.5 HOA & Common-Interest Safeguards

**1.5.1 HOA Responsibility for Common Areas**  
Where property is controlled by an HOA:
- the HOA is responsible for blight, safety, and upkeep of unsold or common units.

**1.5.2 Opt-Out & Control Limits**  
HOAs may not:
- impose nonessential restrictions unrelated to safety,
- extract disproportionate fees,
- retain control when a majority of lots remain unsold beyond a defined period.

Ownership must not be rendered nominal by private governance.

---

## Example Scenarios (Illustrative)

**Example 1: Ownership ≠ Immunity**  
A property owner claims full ownership prevents blight enforcement.  
→ Ownership does not override safety or maintenance obligations.

**Example 2: Trust Abuse**  
Homes are placed into multiple trusts to evade accumulation limits.  
→ Beneficial ownership rules collapse the structure.

**Example 3: Inherited Property**  
A minor inherits a home and cannot immediately maintain it.  
→ Enforcement pauses; penalties do not accrue.

---

## Why This Section Exists

Without clear limits:
- ownership becomes a shield for neglect,
- housing is hoarded,
- communities decay,
- affordability collapses.

This section ensures ownership remains **meaningful, fair, and socially compatible**.

---

<!--
SUMMARY:
Creates a regulated framework for housing and land valuation based on real costs, wage growth, and condition.
Introduces Regulated Assessed Current Value (RACV) to prevent price gouging and speculation.
Addresses vacancy, blight, rezoning windfalls, and unequal market access.
Ensures housing prices reflect reality rather than artificial scarcity.
-->

# 🏠 Housing & Land  
## Section 2 — Housing, Land & Valuation Protections

## Plain-English Summary  
Housing prices should reflect real costs, real improvements, and real use — not speculation, artificial scarcity, or unchecked market manipulation. This section establishes fair valuation standards, prevents price gouging, curbs land hoarding, and ensures housing remains accessible to local residents.

---

## Legal-Style Provisions

### 2.1 Regulated Assessed Current Value (RACV)

**2.1.1 Baseline Valuation Standard**  
All residential property shall be assigned a **Regulated Assessed Current Value (RACV)** calculated as:
- original purchase or construction cost,
- plus approved inflation adjustments tied to wage growth,
- plus documented improvements,
- minus verified deterioration or deferred maintenance.

**2.1.2 Market Limitation Rule**  
Market comparables alone may not justify prices exceeding RACV limits.

---

### 2.2 Permissible Variance & Sale Caps

**2.2.1 Negotiation Allowance**  
Sellers may list property within a limited percentage above RACV to allow for:
- negotiation,
- assessment variance,
- localized demand.

**2.2.2 Absolute Price Ceiling**  
Under no circumstance may a sale exceed the RACV plus permissible variance unless purchased for verified personal occupancy by a priority buyer.

---

### 2.3 Anti-Speculation & Vacancy Controls

**2.3.1 Use Requirement**  
Residential land and housing may not be held vacant beyond defined thresholds without:
- legitimate renovation,
- or approved hardship exemption.

Properties must be advertised in venues accessible to:
- local residents,
- individual buyers,
- non-corporate purchasers.

**2.6.2 Prohibited Targeting**  
Exclusive advertising to corporations or private investor networks violates priority access rules.

---

## Example Scenarios (Illustrative)

**Example 1: Price Gouging**  
A home purchased for $100,000 is listed at $300,000 without improvements.  
→ Sale is capped at RACV plus permissible variance.

**Example 2: Neglected Property**  
A home with mold and roof damage is assessed at full market value.  
→ Repair costs must reduce RACV.

**Example 3: Rezoned Land**  
Land value spikes after rezoning from agricultural to residential.  
→ Speculative uplift is restricted.

---

## Why This Section Exists

Unregulated housing markets:
- outpace wages,
- reward speculation,
- lock people out of ownership.

This section restores **price realism, local access, and accountability**.

---

<!--
SUMMARY:
Applies valuation realism to apartments, condos, and multi-unit housing.
Prevents empty units from inflating rent for occupied tenants.
Requires rent to reflect base cost, condition, and actual occupancy rather than market manipulation.
Addresses large-scale vacancy, speculative holding, and misuse of rental pricing models.
-->

# 🏠 Housing & Land  
## Section 3 — Rentals, Multi-Unit Housing & Lodging

## Plain-English Summary  
Renters should not be forced to subsidize vacancy, speculation, or artificial scarcity. Rental pricing must reflect real costs, real occupancy, and real maintenance — not market manipulation. This section ensures fair rent calculation, prevents abuse in multi-unit properties, and regulates short- and long-term lodging to protect affordability.

---

## Legal-Style Provisions

### 3.1 Base Rent & Cost-Based Pricing

**3.1.1 Rental Baseline Standard**  
Rent for residential units shall be calculated from:

- Regulated Assessed Current Value (RACV) of the property, plus  
- Approved inflation adjustments, plus  
- Documented operating costs, divided by  
- Total habitable units.

**3.1.2 Prohibition on Market-Only Rent Setting**  
Rental prices may not be justified solely by market rates where those rates exceed cost-based calculations.

---

### 3.2 Unit-Based Allocation & Fair Distribution

- or forced proximity to campus.

---

### 3.6 Campgrounds, RV Parks & Long-Term Lodging

**3.6.1 Lodging Classification**  
Campgrounds, RV parks, and extended-stay lodging serving long-term residents are treated as residential housing for pricing purposes.

**3.6.2 Cost-Aligned Pricing**  
Rates must reflect:
- land value,
- provided utilities,
- amenities offered,
and may not exceed reasonable residential equivalents.

---

## Example Scenarios (Illustrative)

**Example 1: Vacancy Cost Abuse**  
An apartment building has 40 units, but only 15 are rented. Remaining tenants see rent increases.  
→ This is prohibited. Vacancy costs belong to the owner.

**Example 2: Unequal Unit Pricing**  
A landlord charges identical rent for a 2-bedroom and a 4-bedroom unit.  
→ Rent must be proportionally allocated.

**Example 3: Student Rent Inflation**  
A landlord raises rent only during the academic year near a university.  
→ Seasonal student-based inflation is prohibited.

---

## Why This Section Exists

Rent inflation driven by vacancy, speculation, and unequal pricing:
- punishes tenants,
- destabilizes communities,
- and accelerates housing insecurity.

This section restores **fairness, transparency, and cost realism** to rental housing.

---

<!--
SUMMARY:
Applies affordability and valuation realism to vehicles and transportation.
Addresses inflated vehicle pricing, paper plate abuse, and dealer manipulation.
Aligns insurance premiums with actual risk and vehicle value.
Ensures emergency transportation is treated as a public service, not a financial penalty.
-->

# 🚗 Vehicles & Transportation  
## Section 4 — Vehicles, Registration & Transportation Costs

## Plain-English Summary  
Transportation is a necessity, not a luxury. Vehicle prices, registration practices, and transportation-related costs must reflect real value and real use — not artificial scarcity, dealer manipulation, or insurance inflation.

Individuals may not be billed out-of-pocket for emergency transport beyond standardized public rates.

---

## Example Scenarios (Illustrative)

**Example 1: Used Car Inflation**  
A used vehicle with high mileage is priced near the cost of a new model.  
→ This violates valuation and depreciation standards.

**Example 2: Paper Plate Abuse**  
A driver repeatedly uses temporary plates to avoid registration fees.  
→ This constitutes fraud and triggers enforcement.

**Example 3: Emergency Ambulance Ride**  
An individual is billed thousands for a mandatory ambulance ride.  
→ Charges beyond standardized public rates are prohibited.

---

## Why This Section Exists

Transportation costs are a major driver of financial instability.  
Unchecked pricing and insurance abuse:
- trap workers,
- block access to employment,
- and punish compliance.

This section restores **fair value, transparency, and accountability** to transportation.

---

<!--
SUMMARY:
Protects workers from constructive discharge, wage suppression, and contract abuse.
Establishes wage baselines tied to real affordability rather than arbitrary minimums.
Reforms tipped labor, unemployment access, and layoff notice requirements.

---

### 5.6 Shift Timing & Worker Health

**5.6.1 Minimum Rest Periods**  
Employers must provide a minimum rest interval between shifts unless:
- adequate sleeping accommodations are provided,
- or emergency services justify extended shifts.

---

## Example Scenarios (Illustrative)

**Example 1: Constructive Discharge**  
An employer cuts an employee’s hours and reassigns duties to force resignation.  
→ This is treated as a layoff with full unemployment eligibility.

**Example 2: Tipped Wage Abuse**  
A server earns strong tips but is paid below minimum wage hourly.  
→ Employer owes back pay regardless of tip totals.

**Example 3: Multi-State Worker**  
A worker commutes between states with different minimum wages.  
→ The highest applicable wage applies.

---

## Why This Section Exists

Wage suppression and job instability:
