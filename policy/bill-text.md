# Definitions & Valuation (Core Methods)

**Purpose.** Tie prices to wages and real condition so affordability tracks incomes, not hype.

## §1.1 Terms
- **Original Purchase Price (OPP):** Price paid when last acquired at arm’s length (closing statement).  
- **Wage Index:** The time-weighted ratio of local median wages between the purchase year and now, with a hard cap at the simple wage ratio. *(Policy Dial)*  
- **Wage‑Indexed Value (WIV):** OPP × Wage Index + **Documented Improvements** (capital only; no routine maintenance).  
- **Repair‑Adjusted Current Value (RACV):** As‑is fair value **minus Required Repairs** to meet habitability/code.  
- **Applicable Value (AV):** **Lesser of WIV and RACV.**  
- **Permissible Variance (PV):** Narrow, documented leeway applied **after** AV is set:  
  - **Negotiation Margin (NM)** for sales *(Policy Dial: default 3–5%)*  
  - **Rent Tolerance Band (RTB)** for rents *(Policy Dial: default ±3%)*

## §1.2 Improvements that count
Capital items that extend life or capacity: structural, roof, envelope, systems, code-required work, accessibility, energy upgrades. DIY allowed with receipts. Decorative/maintenance (paint, cleaning, landscaping upkeep) do **not** increase WIV.

## §1.3 Required Repairs (for RACV)
Life-safety, envelope integrity, mechanical/electrical/plumbing, pest/mold remediation, code defects. Estimates use department cost guides; owner may submit verified bids.

## §1.4 Safeguards against appraisal gaming
- **Rotating assessor/inspector panels** with blind assignment.  
- **Transparent cost guides** published annually.  
- **Dual-inspection option:** owner or buyer may trigger a second inspection; AV uses the more conservative repair deduction.  
- **Conflict firewall:** assessors may not appraise properties they marketed, designed, or managed in last 3 years.  
- **Random audits:** ≥10% of valuations audited each year *(Policy Dial)*.

## §1.5 Appeals — Valuation Review Board (VRB)
Fast, paper‑first review within **45 days**. If owner prevails ≥2%, AV is corrected and any taxes/fees/rents/sale caps recalculated; over‑collections refunded with interest.

## §1.6 Penalties & transparency
Misstatements or cap evasion → rescission, restitution, and civil penalties; repeat actors face license suspension. De‑identified valuation data (inputs, ranges) published for accountability.

> **Universal Rule:** **Set AV = min(WIV, RACV).** Only then may NM/RTB apply. NM/RTB cannot offset missing repairs.

# Single‑Family & Land Reset

## §2.1 Sale Price Cap
Final consideration ≤ **AV + NM** (downward unlimited). No side payments or “key money.” Closing costs cannot be used to exceed cap.

## §2.2 First‑Look & Owner‑Occupant Priority
- **First‑Look window** (e.g., 5 business days) open to: existing tenant intending to buy, first‑time buyer, local owner‑occupant, qualified nonprofit/CLT.  
- **Priority ladder** within First‑Look; tie‑breaker is **earliest verified registry timestamp**. No above‑cap escalations to break ties.

## §2.3 Land & Improvements
Land treated like housing; only **infrastructure** (utilities, grading, access, code-required environmental mitigation) counts as improvement. Speculative holding does not.

## §2.4 Trusts & Inheritance
Beneficial owner rules apply. Minors inherit with a maintenance duty carried by the trustee; public trust may step in for needed repairs with a lien capped at cost.

## §2.5 Mortgage/Deed of Trust Alignment
If AV reset < unpaid principal: servicer must offer (i) term extension, (ii) rate modification, or (iii) principal write‑down to AV without fresh credit pull; no negative credit reporting for accepting a reset.

## §2.6 Offer Integrity (cross‑refer §6)
Pre‑verification, anti‑bot, rate limits, beneficial‑owner consolidation, and public de‑identified logs are mandatory.

## §2.7 Closing & Fees
Admin/processing/title add‑ons capped; only truly optional services may be itemized. Fees pegged to **hours of local minimum wage** *(Policy Dial)*.

## §2.8 Enforcement
Overcharge → refund + 2× penalty; repeat → license discipline and suspension from registry.

---

# Rezoned Properties & Value Capture

## §3.1 Baseline by Original Zoning
Rezoning alone cannot raise AV. Baseline remains OPP and OPP‑era zoning until physical improvements are constructed and inspected.

## §3.2 Build‑Out Exception
When built consistent with new zoning, add **verified development costs** (hard + permitted soft costs) to WIV; still subject to **min(WIV, RACV)**.

## §3.3 Rezoning Dividend
A majority share *(Policy Dial: e.g., 60%)* of rezoning‑created land value is captured to a local Housing & Infrastructure Fund, payable at certificate of occupancy or sale, whichever comes first.

## §3.4 Anti‑Flip Hold
Rezoned but unbuilt parcels held >24 months incur a **holding surtax** or must auction at **AV** to qualified builders/CLTs.

## §3.5 Residential vs. Commercial
Mixed‑use splits pro‑rata by floor area; residential portions follow housing caps; commercial portions follow a parallel wage/repair rule with an NM suited to commercial markets *(Policy Dial)*.

---

# Blight, Neglect, Trusts & Inherited Property

## §4.1 Vacancy & Blight
- **Vacant** >12 months or **unsafe** conditions trigger notices.  
- **Chronic blight** (>24 months or 2+ serious violations) → compulsory remediation or **conveyance to land bank** at AV.

## §4.2 Junkyard Misuse
Outdoor storage/junkyard operations in residential zones incur escalating fines and corrective orders; failure to cure may lead to compulsory sale at AV.

## §4.3 Trusts & Estates
Trustee owes a **maintenance duty**; if minors/disabled beneficiaries cannot fund repairs, the public trust may front repairs with a capped lien; property is not seized solely due to beneficiary age.

## §4.4 Due Process
Clear notices, cure timelines, right to VRB appeal, and judicial review. Hardship plans available; liens capped at documented repair costs plus modest admin *(Policy Dial)*.

---

# Multi‑Unit Properties (Apartments/Condos)

## §5.1 Occupancy Floor & Ghost Inventory
Vacancy >20% without active renovation triggers a **vacancy surtax** (graduated) and a plan to lease/sell units at capped prices.

## §5.2 Rent Formation
For each unit: **Unit Share of AV** (by usable sq ft or rooms) + pro‑rata O&M budget = **Base Rent**; apply **RTB** *(Policy Dial: ±3%)*. Publish a **Rent Breakdown Sheet**.

## §5.3 Downward Adjustments
If current condition would yield a lower rent under RACV than under WIV, the tenant pays the **lesser** amount. Neglect cannot increase rent.

## §5.4 Conversion & Tenant Rights
Conversions require a tenant **right of first refusal**, relocation aid, and rent caps during transition.

## §5.5 Common Areas & Capital Plans
Reserve studies every 3 years; capital plans posted. Special assessments must tie to the plan or emergencies; installment options required.

---

# Certified Offer Registry, Anti‑Bot, and Priority Ladder

## §6.4 Offer Window
Minimum **5 business days** (Policy Dial) before selection unless only one conforming offer exists and First‑Look is not active.

## §6.5 Priority Ladder
1) Existing tenant → 2) First‑time owner‑occupant → 3) Local owner‑occupant → 4) Other owner‑occupant → 5) Qualified nonprofit/CLT → 6) Natural‑person non‑occupant → 7) Entity/investor.  
Tie within rung: **earliest verified timestamp**; if identical, a limited lottery. Price may not exceed cap.

## §6.6 Transparency & Penalties
De‑identified offer logs published; violations (bots, shells, shill bids) → rescission, $50k per‑listing civil penalties *(Policy Dial)*, and registry suspension.

Homesteads and rentals assessed at **min(WIV, RACV)** with mandatory repair deductions. Assessors may not exceed either input.

## §14.2 Revenue‑Neutral Rollback (Truth‑in‑Taxation+)
When total assessed value rises, millage rolls back so levy growth ≤ **wage index** unless voters approve more. If values fall, millage may adjust to hold services steady but levy growth still ≤ wage index without a vote.

## §14.3 Circuit‑Breaker Relief
Refund/credit taxes above **X% of household income** *(Policy Dial: 5–7%)*. Automatic with annual income verification; renters treated via a deemed‑tax share of rent *(Policy Dial: 15–20%)*.

# Student Housing & Boarding Prices

## §15.1 Scope
Covers on-campus and university-affiliated housing, master-leased blocks, and third-party (P3) student housing marketed primarily to enrolled students, plus mandatory or bundled **meal plans**.

## §15.2 Price Formation (Boarding Price Cap)
For each term, set a **Boarding Price Cap (BPC)** per bed =  
**Cost of Provision per Bed** (O&M + staffing + utilities + campus services)  
+ **Capital Reserve** (for major repairs; policy dial: 6–10% of O&M)  
+ **Wage Guard** (≤ local wage index change year-over-year)  
+ **Modest Margin** (policy dial: ≤ 5%).  
Publish a **Boarding Statement** with these line items.

> BPC is a *ceiling*; scholarships/grants may lower student charges below BPC.

## §15.3 Ring-Fencing & No Cross-Subsidy
Housing/boarding revenue and designated housing funds are **ring-fenced**: no transfers to athletics, endowment, or unrelated operations. Surpluses must either (i) reduce next term’s BPC or (ii) fund capital reserves.

## §15.4 Meal Plans & Bundling
- No **mandatory** meal plan bundling unless the facility lacks in-unit kitchens *and* a basic plan is offered at cost.  
- Meal plan pricing must show food cost, labor, overhead, and margin (≤ 5%). Unused balances refundable at term’s end minus actual card processing costs.

## §15.5 First-Look & Priority
Priority ladder: (1) houseless/financial-need students, (2) first-year, (3) international, (4) remainder; lottery within rung if oversubscribed.

## §15.6 Third-Party Providers (P3)
Affiliates and P3s must: (a) adopt BPC, (b) publish Boarding Statements, (c) accept audit, (d) honor §7 Payment Integrity (no cash-only). Violations → refunds + penalties; repeat → loss of affiliation.

## §15.7 Transparency & Audits
Post audited Boarding Statements each term. Random audits ≥10% annually (policy dial). Overcharges → refund + 2× penalty; future BPC reduced by the overcharge rate.

## §15.8 Habitability & Repairs
Apply RACV logic: unsafe or substandard units trigger **mandatory credits** until cured; neglect cannot justify higher pricing.

---

# Development Grants, Subsidies & Incentives

## §16.1 Pass-Through to End Buyers/Renters
Any public grant, tax credit, land discount, fee waiver, or infrastructure contribution **reduces** the **Wage-Indexed Value (WIV)** dollar-for-dollar for affected units so the benefit lowers the **Applicable Value (AV)** and capped rent/sale price.

## §16.2 No Double Counting
Developers may not add subsidized costs to WIV. Public dollars offset private cost basis first.

## §16.3 Conditions, Reporting, Clawbacks
Publish subsidy term sheets and unit-level benefit pass-throughs. Non-compliance → (i) price/rent rollback, (ii) restitution, (iii) clawback of incentives, and (iv) ineligibility for 3 years.

## §16.4 Affordability Period
Subsidized units carry an affordability period (policy dial: 20–30 years) during which AV caps and income targeting apply.

## §16.5 Grant-to-Value Converter
In pro formas, treat grants as **negative basis**; financing models must show a consumer price effect commensurate with the subsidy.

## §16.6 Interaction with §3 Rezoning Dividend
Public incentives may satisfy part of the rezoning dividend if they are applied to on-site affordability at or below AV; documentation required.

---

# Tariff Impacts on Housing/Vehicle Materials

## §17.1 Purpose
Neutralize **federal tariff** shocks on essential inputs (e.g., lumber, steel, transformers, glass) that would otherwise raise consumer prices under this Act.

## §17.2 Tariff Impact Offset (TIO) — State/Local
If a verified tariff increases the landed cost of an eligible input used in covered projects:
- The jurisdiction may grant a **Tariff Impact Offset** (rebate/credit) equal to the tariff burden actually paid, conditioned on full **pass-through** to the buyer/renter via a lower AV or capped price.
- Offsets **do not** raise AV; they **reduce** WIV (negative basis) to keep end prices flat.

## §17.3 Documentation & Sunset
Require supplier invoices showing tariff line items and dates. Offsets sunset automatically when the federal tariff is reduced/removed; any remaining reserves revert to the housing fund.

## §17.4 Federal Harmonization (Model Resolution)
Urge Congress/USITC to approve temporary duty-free treatment for designated critical housing components during shortages, with mandatory retail pass-through and clawbacks for non-compliance.

## §17.5 Audit & Enforcement
Random audits ≥10%. False claims → treble damages; vendors may be barred from public procurement for 3 years.

---

# Tax & Marital-Status Equity (Property & Access)

## §18.1 Marital Neutrality Principle
All state/local tax benefits and homeowner programs apply **without preference** for marital status. No bonuses or penalties based solely on being single, married, divorced, or widowed.

## §18.2 Circuit Breaker by Income, Not Status
Property-tax circuit breakers (§14.3) use **household income** thresholds with identical schedules for single and married filers. Benefits are based on income and domicile, not marital status.

## §18.3 Homestead & Credits
Homestead exemptions, first-time buyer credits, and fee waivers apply per **household domicile**, not marital status. One homestead per household.

## §18.4 Mortgage & Program Access
Public programs and jurisdiction-backed loans must use **ability-to-repay** metrics neutral to marital status; co-borrowers (related or unrelated) are treated symmetrically. Programs may not require marriage to combine incomes.

## §18.5 Withholding & Refund Guidance (Model Federal Ask)
Recommend federal tables that eliminate marriage penalties/bonuses at common income bands; until then, state withholding tables should provide a **single-filer neutral** option mirroring married-filer rates at equal income.

## §18.6 Anti-Discrimination
Vendors, lenders, and tax offices are prohibited from conditioning discounts or priority on marital status, except where mandated by federal law (e.g., surviving-spouse veteran benefits).
