# Affordability Act — Compiled Master
_Generated (UTC): 2025-10-24 06:18 UTC_

<!--
SUMMARY:
Defines the fundamental rights and responsibilities of property ownership under the Affordability Act.
Covers valuation, equity, and transparency standards to ensure homes, land, and other assets remain accessible and fairly priced.
Outlines how regulated assessment values (RACV) are calculated and verified through audit.
-->
# SECTION 1 — FOUNDATIONS OF OWNERSHIP & HOUSING STABILITY

## 1.1 Purpose
Stabilize residential and land pricing by anchoring values to real inflation and verifiable improvements, not speculative escalation.

## 1.2 Evaluation Standard (Core Method)
Adjusted Value (RACV) = Base Price + (Cumulative Wage-Indexed Inflation × Eligible Years) + Documented Capital Improvements − Certified Habitability Repairs.

## 1.3 Assessment Integrity
Assessors must disclose methodology; use comps filtered for distortion; and apply repair deductions. Peer review every 3 years with citizen auditors. Systematic overstatements trigger penalties and retraining.

## 1.4 Blight & Neglect
Properties left derelict or used as unlicensed junkyards are subject to graduated orders, fines, and, if necessary, temporary receivership. If a parcel lies within an HOA, the HOA assumes interim maintenance (lawncare, exterior safety) until individual resale.

## 1.5 Full-Ownership Guarantee & Safeguard
Ownership conveys full control **subject to** public-interest, safety, environmental, and affordability laws in this Act. Permits remain required for new structures, major remodels, and utility connections; permitting shall be simplified, capped-cost, and non-discretionary. Anti-monopoly guard: no person or entity may accumulate holdings that materially restrict access or create scarcity in a local market.

## 1.6 HOA Accountability & Opt-Out
Owners may petition to opt out of non-transparent or non-performing HOAs; where <50% of lots are sold/occupied, HOA authority is limited to essential maintenance and financial transparency, subject to municipal oversight.

## 1.7 Fair Advertising Clause
Listings must appear on public, accessible portals; restricting exposure to private corporate channels violates equal-access and the buyer priority ladder.

## 1.8 Title Protection & Anti-Deed Fraud
Automatic title-lock enrollment at recording; verified owner contact before transfer; criminal penalties for forged deeds; expedited restoration processes for victims.

## 1.9 Easement & Long-Lease Buyout Safeguards
Buyouts must disclose lifetime value impact certified by an independent appraiser; include a 7-day cooling-off period; easements >20 years trigger valuation credits for tax/financing.

---

<!--
SUMMARY:
Outlines the legal and ethical standards for fair access to housing and land.
Includes single-family and multi-unit affordability rules, zoning protections, blight enforcement, inheritance clauses, and HOA opt-out provisions.
Ensures that all housing stock and land remain accessible for residents, not speculative investment.
-->
# SECTION 2 — HOUSING ACCESS & ANTI-SPECULATION MEASURES

## 2.1 Certified Offer Registry
All offers are time-stamped in a certified registry; auditable for shill/phantom bids.

## 2.2 Anti-Bot & Auto-Purchase Ban
Automated mass-purchase systems are prohibited; violations void the sale and trigger penalties.

## 2.3 Priority Ladder
Order: (1) local resident ≥2 years; (2) in-state resident; (3) domestic buyer; (4) nonprofit/co-op; (5) corporate buyer. Within a rung, first qualified application prevails.

## 2.4 Equal Market Exposure
Sellers must advertise through approved public channels reaching all priority rungs; exclusive corporate funnels are unlawful.

## 2.5 Vacancy Accountability (No Tenant Offset)
Units vacant >12 months incur an idle-asset duty. **Occupied tenants may not** face rent/fee increases to offset vacancy penalties or losses.

---

<!--
SUMMARY:
Regulates the property and rental market to prevent manipulation, automation abuse, and exclusionary practices.
Establishes the Certified Offer Registry, anti-bot safeguards, and a resident-priority ladder to protect individuals from being priced out.
Includes rules for transparent payments, digital records, and equal advertising reach.
-->
# SECTION 3 — PAYMENT INTEGRITY, VEHICLES & COMMERCE FAIRNESS

## 3.1 Payment Integrity (All Housing/Lodging Contracts)
At least one low-fee, traceable electronic method must be accepted; itemized receipts required; cash-only mandates banned except during verified outages.

### 3.1a Digital & Non-Digital Access Parity
For notices, payments, registries, and appeals, provide both online and accessible non-digital alternatives.

## 3.2 Multi-Payment Contract Oversight
Lease-to-own, rent-to-own, and financing agreements must issue automated receipts and clear amortization tables; junk fee pass-throughs are void.

## 3.3 Dealer Add-On Opt-Out
Consumers may decline any optional add-on without impact to approval, term, or rate. A base vehicle price must be disclosed before financing.

## 3.4 Motor-Vehicle Valuation Reversion
Resale and insurance valuations derive from MSRP adjusted for age, mileage, and condition tiers. Antiques/rarities may use certified premium tiers with documentation.

## 3.5 Temporary Registration Accountability & Transparency
Temp tags require scannable public verification (QR/NFC) with issuance/expiry, dealer ID, and basic vehicle data; dealers are capped to inventory-linked issuance and audited. Operating with expired/unverifiable temp tags beyond 10 days is unregistered operation. Cross-state verification required; hardship extensions available where agency delay is documented.

## 3.6 Right-to-Repair
Manufacturers must provide diagnostics, parts, and documentation to independent repairers at fair cost; anti-circumvention of repair is prohibited.

## 3.7 Fair Repossession Practices
Grace periods, capped repossession fees, and surplus-proceeds refunds are mandatory; buy-here-pay-here schemes face enhanced scrutiny.

## 3.8 Fair Banking Transaction Sequencing
Reordering transactions to increase overdraft fees is prohibited; default behavior is decline-at-zero with a single transparent fee cap.

<!--
SUMMARY:

# SECTION 4 — COMMUNAL, UTILITY & INFRASTRUCTURE STANDARDS

## 4.1 Timeshares & Fractional Interests
Resale and annual fees tie to RACV of the underlying asset and the actual usage right; perpetual escalators detached from cost are unlawful; clear exit paths required.

## 4.2 Campgrounds, RV Parks & Short-Term Lodging
Long-stay pricing = land RACV + shared-service costs + modest margin; amenity/seasonal premiums allowed if real and disclosed.

All new construction must install fiber-optic conduit or equivalent high-speed broadband alongside power/water; legacy copper qualifies only where fiber is physically impractical.

## 4.4 Minimum Service Baseline
Each new dwelling must have broadband sufficient for remote work, education, and telehealth; the local standard is published by the utility board.

## 4.5 Utility Volatility Controls
No more than one rate change per quarter; increases > inflation +2% require verified cost justification and a 60-day notice with appeal rights; seasonal surcharges must be smoothed over the year.

## 4.6 Baseline ISP Plan & Regional Equity
ISPs must offer a baseline plan (e.g., 25 Mbps or higher, reviewed periodically) at uniform rates across ZIPs in the service region; last-mile subsidies flow from the Affordability Fund, not consumer surcharges.

## 5.5 Education & Boarding Costs
Room/board caps align with campus housing RACV and transparent operating costs; pro-rata refunds for service loss.

(c) FAC–IRS Task Force may claw back for up to 10 years upon patterns of evasion or serial filings.  
(d) Post-bankruptcy net worth >150% of pre-filing within 5 years triggers review and possible restitution.

## 5.7 Offshore Asset & Tax Transparency

# SECTION 6 — CREDIT, EMPLOYMENT & WORKER EQUITY

## 6.1 Credit Inquiry Reform
No hard pulls without explicit written consent for a specific transaction; unsuccessful applications auto-convert to soft pulls within 7 days; multiple pulls within 30 days count as one.

## 6.2 Alternative Qualification Standards
A non-credit pathway using verified income, employment stability (≥6 months), debt-to-income, and bill payment histories.
