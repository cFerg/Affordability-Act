This outline summarizes each section at a glance. Click through for full text.

## 01 — Definitions & Valuation (Core Methods)

[Open section](sections/01_definitions_and_valuation/README.md)

Defines Real-Affordability-Constrained Value (RACV): start from original build/buy cost, index only by local wage changes, add verifiable capital improvements, subtract documented habitability repairs. Sets uniform inputs, forbids comp-driven inflation, and anchors both sale caps and rent math.

_Keywords:_ racv, valuation, wage, index, improvements, repair, offsets, ceilings

## 02 — Single‑Family & Land Reset

[Open section](sections/02_sf_land_reset/README.md)

Rebases single-family homes and raw land to RACV and applies a duty-to-use/list for long-vacant parcels. Active-renovation and hardship safe harbors apply; chronic warehousing triggers a graduated vacancy duty (creditable to taxes) and fast-track abatement for hazards.

_Keywords:_ single, family, land, reset, vacancy, duty, hardship, waiver

## 03 — Rezoned Properties & Value Capture

[Open section](sections/03_rezoned_properties/README.md)

When upzoning raises development potential, the rezoning increment is captured for public benefit and may not inflate RACV for existing units. Sellers may realize a limited, formulaic share only upon build-out; speculative flips post-rezone cannot exceed RACV + variance.

_Keywords:_ rezoning, value, capture, upzoning, speculation, public, benefit

## 04 — Blight, Neglect, Trusts & Inherited Property

[Open section](sections/04_blight_neglect_trusts/README.md)

Sets a duty to maintain habitability and exterior standards; repair costs reduce RACV until cured to end “profit from neglect.” Trusts/estates receive grace periods and a maintenance-only standard (esp. with minor heirs) while preventing trusts from parking properties vacant.

_Keywords:_ blight, neglect, trusts, estates, heirs, habitability, grace, period

## 05 — Multi‑Unit Properties (Apartments/Condos)

[Open section](sections/05_multi_unit/README.md)

Derives lawful rent from building RACV allocated by unit size/bedrooms, with transparent adders for standard services and verified upgrades. Requires public occupancy reporting and applies a modest duty on chronically vacant units to deter warehousing.

_Keywords:_ multi-unit, rent, formula, allocation, occupancy, vacancy, duty

## 06 — Certified Offer Registry, Anti‑Bot, and Priority Ladder

[Open section](sections/06_offer_registry/README.md)

All offers are logged in a certified registry (time-stamped, auditable). Bans phantom/shill bids and automated bot sniping. If multiple qualified buyers exist, seller must choose via the priority ladder (owner-occupants, local residents, etc.) and first-come within that rung—never by busting the cap.

_Keywords:_ offer, registry, anti-shill, anti-bot, priority, ladder, transparency

## 07 — Payment Integrity (All Housing/Lodging Contracts)

[Open section](sections/07_payment_integrity/README.md)

Requires at least one low-fee, traceable electronic payment option and itemized receipts; bans “cash-only/money-order-only” mandates except during verified outages. Prohibits junk add-on fees that function as price-cap evasion; mandates clean ledgers for deposits, rent-to-own, STRs, and hotels.

_Keywords:_ payments, receipts, electronic, fee, limits, compliance, traceability

## 08 — Motor Vehicles — Pricing Reversion & Dealer Practices

[Open section](sections/08_vehicles/README.md)

Caps used-vehicle prices by a Normalized Market Value (NMV) from MSRP, age, mileage, and condition tiers; antiques/rarities have higher but defined caps. Bans junk fees, pegs doc fees to local wage hours, and requires itemized add-ons/trade-ins so caps can’t be bypassed.

_Keywords:_ vehicles, nmv, doc, fee, condition, tiers, add-ons, transparency

## 09 — Insurance — Premium Fairness (Auto/Home/Renters)

[Open section](sections/09_insurance/README.md)

Premiums must track actual loss experience and risk—not generic “inflation.” Requires pass-through credits when severities fall, bans proxy redlining, and mandates public rate filings and audit rights. Insurance costs cannot be used to inflate RACV.

_Keywords:_ insurance, premiums, pass-through, risk, rating, filings, audit, rights

## 10 — Timeshares & Fractional Interests

[Open section](sections/10_timeshares/README.md)

Ties resale ceilings and annual fees to RACV of the underlying property and the real usage right purchased. Outlaws perpetual escalators detached from costs; mandates clear, affordable exit paths and forbids predatory relief schemes.

_Keywords:_ timeshare, fractional, resale, caps, fees, exits, consumer, protection

## 11 — HOAs, Condos & Co‑ops (Common‑Interest Communities)

[Open section](sections/11_hoas_condos_coops/README.md)

Aligns dues/special assessments with documented O&M and reserve studies; bans “amenity inflation” to mimic rent hikes. Sets member-vote thresholds for major projects and offers hardship deferrals that don’t snowball penalties.

_Keywords:_ hoa, co-op, assessments, reserves, hardship, governance

## 12 — Campgrounds & RV Parks

[Open section](sections/12_campgrounds_rv/README.md)

For long-stay sites, prices are cost-based: land RACV + shared-service costs + modest margin. Seasonal and amenity premiums allowed if disclosed and real. Stops surge-gouging while preserving sustainable operations.

_Keywords:_ campgrounds, rv, parks, long-stay, amenities, seasonal, pricing

## 13 — Local Voting Integrity (Model Policy)

[Open section](sections/13_local_voting/README.md)

Model rule to prevent multi-property owners from exerting outsized influence: civic voting eligibility and local property-policy referenda are tied to a single primary residence per person. Ensures uniform residency definitions and verification without burdening ordinary voters.

_Keywords:_ voting, integrity, primary, residence, residency, anti-stacking, model, policy

## 14 — Property Taxes — Assessment & Levy Alignment

[Open section](sections/14_property_taxes/README.md)

Assessed values must align with RACV, exclude speculative comps, and recognize verified repair offsets. Levies and caps index to local wages; circuit breakers protect low-income seniors/disabled. Prevents tax bills from rising faster than affordability baselines.

_Keywords:_ property, tax, assessment, levy, caps, circuit, breaker, wage

## 15 — Student Housing & Boarding Prices

[Open section](sections/15_student_housing_boarding/README.md)

Caps room-and-board using campus-housing RACV and published operating costs; requires transparent meal-plan math and forbids cross-subsidies from academics. Provides hardship accommodations and pro-rata refunds for closures/service loss.

_Keywords:_ student, housing, boarding, cost, transparency, caps, hardship

## 16 — Development Grants, Subsidies & Incentives

[Open section](sections/16_development_grants_incentives/README.md)

Public support must flow through to end-user prices: award conditions require documented pass-through into RACV/rent reductions. Sets clawbacks for non-compliance, local-hiring goals, and open-book cost audits to prevent windfalls.

_Keywords:_ grants, subsidies, incentives, pass-through, clawbacks, audits

## 17 — Tariff Impacts on Housing/Vehicle Materials

[Open section](sections/17_tariff_impact_offsets/README.md)

Exempts or rebates critical inputs (e.g., lumber, steel, transformers) when tariffs measurably raise RACV; savings must be passed through. Requires a transparent test for materiality and periodic review to avoid abuse.

_Keywords:_ tariffs, materials, exemption, pass-through, affordability, test

## 18 — Tax & Marital-Status Equity (Property & Access)

[Open section](sections/18_tax_and_marital_equity/README.md)

Neutralizes marital-status distortions in property access and taxation: credits/deductions are structured so singles and couples face equivalent effective rates at equal income. Bars preferential mortgage scoring based solely on marital status and harmonizes homestead rules.

_Keywords:_ tax, equity, marital, status, homestead, mortgage, access, parity

## 19 — Wage Baselines & Tipped Work (Affordability Link)

[Open section](sections/19_wages_and_tips/README.md)

Sets the wage index used for RACV and mandates that employers meet full minimum wage in cash—tips are additive. Codifies back-pay math (without tip offsets), requires pay-statement breakouts, and standardizes service-charge treatment to stop tip theft.

_Keywords:_ wage, index, minimum, tipped, work, back, pay, service

## 20 — Uniform Enforcement, Remedies & Procedure

[Open section](sections/20_uniform_enforcement/README.md)

Creates a unified toolbox: audits, subpoenas, and corrective orders; restitution to harmed buyers/tenants takes priority over fines. Graduated penalties for willful overpricing, shill bidding, and appraisal fraud; whistleblower rewards; and public dashboards for transparency.

_Keywords:_ enforcement, remedies, audits, penalties, restitution, transparency

## 21 — 21 — Fiscal Neutrality & Hold-Harmless (Jobs, Taxes & Fees)

[Open section](sections/21_fiscal_neutrality_and_hold_harmless/README.md)

Prevents employers and governments from offsetting affordability reforms by cutting pay, hours, or benefits, or by raising taxes/fees. Requires fiscal neutrality: savings and new revenues from the Act fund affordability, not general backfill. Strong anti-retaliation, anti-pass-through, and transparency rules ensure workers and residents don’t bear the cost.

_Keywords:_ fiscal, neutrality, hold-harmless, anti-pass-through, anti-retaliation, taxes, fees
