# Price Reversion Act — Outline

_Last updated: 2025-09-27_

## 1) Purpose (in one line)
Realign prices with local wages and real condition so regular people can buy, rent, drive, and insure without getting gouged.

## 2) Core Principles
- **Wage-Indexed Value (WIV):** Original purchase price × local wage index + **documented capital improvements**.
- **Repair-Adjusted Current Value (RACV):** Market value **minus required repairs** to meet habitability/safety codes.
- **Universal safeguard:** **Applicable Value (AV) = _min(WIV, RACV)_**.
- **Permissible Variance (PV):** tight leeway **after** AV is set:
  - **NM (Negotiation Margin)** for sales (default **3–5%**)
  - **RTB (Rent Tolerance Band)** for rents (default **±3%**)
- **No gaming:** rotating assessors, transparent cost guides, dual-inspection option, ≥10% random audits, fast **Valuation Review Board (VRB)**.

## 3) Scope (what the Act covers)
- Housing & land (single-family, small multi-family, condos, lots)
- **Rezoned** property & value capture
- **Blight/neglect** & trusts/inheritance safeguards
- **Multi-unit** rent method + vacancy misuse controls
- **Offer Registry** with anti-bot and owner-occupant priority
- **Payment integrity** across leases/mortgages/HOAs/hotels/STRs
- **Vehicles** (new/used pricing) & **insurance** (auto/home/renters)
- **Timeshares**, **HOAs/condos/co-ops**, **campgrounds/RV parks**
- **Local voting integrity** & **property tax alignment**

## 4) How it works (high level, with links)
- **Single-family & land:** Final price ≤ **AV + NM**; first-look for tenants/first-time/local owner-occupants; land “improvements” limited to real infrastructure; loan mods to AV if underwater.  
  → See: [§02 Single-Family & Land Reset](./sections/02_sf_land_reset/README.md)
- **Rezoning:** New zoning alone can’t raise caps; when built, add verified development costs; share rezoning dividend to local housing fund; anti-flip hold.  
  → See: [§03 Rezoned Properties](./sections/03_rezoned_properties/README.md)
- **Blight & trusts:** Cure timelines; land-bank for chronic neglect; junkyard misuse surcharges; trustees owe maintenance; minors protected.  
  → See: [§04 Blight / Neglect / Trusts](./sections/04_blight_neglect_trusts/README.md)
- **Multi-unit:** Unit rent = share of AV + pro-rata O&M ± RTB; **lesser-of rule** prevents rent hikes from neglect; vacancy surtax if ghost inventory.  
  → See: [§05 Multi-Unit Properties](./sections/05_multi_unit/README.md)
- **Offer Registry:** Human pre-verification, anti-bot, beneficial-owner consolidation, priority ladder (tenant → first-time → local OO → …), de-identified public logs.  
  → See: [§06 Offer Registry](./sections/06_offer_registry/README.md)
- **Payment integrity:** No cash-only—must offer no-fee ACH; receipts + same/next-day posting or $10 credit; surcharge caps; STR off-platform cash ban.  
  → See: [§07 Payment Integrity](./sections/07_payment_integrity/README.md)
- **Vehicles:** New ≤ MSRP + NMV (class-based); used ≤ **min(VWIV − depreciation − repairs, RACVV) + NMV**; doc fee pegged to hours of local minimum wage.  
  → See: [§08 Vehicles](./sections/08_vehicles/README.md)
- **Insurance:** Premiums track lawful values; no-claim/no-change cap; catastrophe surcharges transparent with sunset/clawback; escrow re-run on decreases.  
  → See: [§09 Insurance](./sections/09_insurance/README.md)
- **Timeshares:** RAV → IAV; NM-TS; owner credits; maintenance tied to wages or audited costs; exit/buyback paths.  
  → See: [§10 Timeshares](./sections/10_timeshares/README.md)
- **HOAs/condos/co-ops:** Assessment caps; reserve studies; transparency & rebidding; investor concentration limits; owner-occupant safeguard votes (optional).  
  → See: [§11 HOAs / Condos / Co-ops](./sections/11_hoas_condos_coops/README.md)
- **Campgrounds/RV:** Cost-based nightly rate sheet; wage-indexed increases; no junk fees; ≥30 days = tenancy protections.  
  → See: [§12 Campgrounds & RV](./sections/12_campgrounds_rv/README.md)
- **Local voting integrity:** Single-domicile voting; ban non-resident property ballots; beneficial-owner consolidation.  
  → See: [§13 Local Voting Integrity](./sections/13_local_voting/README.md)
- **Property taxes:** Assess at **min(WIV, RACV)**; revenue-neutral rollback with wage-index guardrail; circuit-breakers; homestead protections.  
  → See: [§14 Property Taxes](./sections/14_property_taxes/README.md)

## 5) Policy dials (defaults to tune via Discussions)

- **Campground margin cap:** ≤10%  
- **Dealer doc-fee peg:** ≤ six hours of local minimum wage

## 6) Implementation & governance
- **Admin setup (0–90 days):** publish cost guides; seat assessor panels & VRB; launch Certified Offer Registry; adopt standard forms.  
- **Rulemaking (0–180 days):** definitions, improvement categories, repair catalogs, vacancy-surtax tables.  
- **Go-live (180+ days):** sales/rents bound by AV; enforcement & dashboards online.  
- **Enforcement:** refunds + civil penalties; license discipline; private right of action; whistleblower protections.

## 7) Stakeholder protections
- **Minors/beneficiaries:** trustees carry maintenance duty; no seizure solely due to age.  
- **Tenants:** first-look + right-of-first-refusal on conversions; relocation aid.  
- **Small owners:** clear repair catalogs, VRB appeals, hardship plans.  
- **Consumers (vehicles/insurance):** transparent out-the-door sheets; premium rollbacks.  
- **Communities:** vacancy controls; land-bank; rezoning value capture for housing/infrastructure.

## 8) Metrics & reporting (publish quarterly)
- Owner-occupant share; median price vs AV; vacancy rate; rent-breakdown compliance  
- Insurance premium deltas & clawbacks; dealership doc-fee adherence  
- VRB turnaround & reversal rates; rezoning dividend collections  
- Property-tax levy growth vs wage index; circuit-breaker utilization
