SUMMARY:
Defines the core ownership principles, valuation methods, and fairness guarantees under the Affordability Act.
Restores balance between property, income, and opportunity by tying valuation to tangible inflation and wage growth rather than speculation.
Creates an auditable, public framework for calculating and reviewing regulated assessed current value (RACV).

# Section 1 — Foundations of Ownership

## Purpose
To establish fair and measurable standards for how all property and major assets are valued, bought, and sold in the United States.  
This section prevents artificial inflation by basing value on factual elements: base construction cost, inflation, improvements, and depreciation.  
It ensures ownership is transparent, enforceable, and immune to speculative abuse.

## Core Valuation Formula
**Base Value + Inflation + Condition Adjustments – Depreciation = Regulated Assessed Current Value (RACV)**

- *Base Value* represents the documented cost of construction or prior purchase.  
- *Inflation* applies only for the time since the last recorded sale or improvement, using the standardized **Wage-Linked Inflation Index (WLII)** to ensure affordability parity.  
- *Condition Adjustments* apply for verified upgrades or restorations.  
- *Depreciation* reflects wear, neglect, or regional decline.

The RACV represents the *maximum allowable baseline* for property listings, insurance assessments, or tax valuation, subject to the **Permissible Variance** (currently capped at 10%).

## Auditing and Oversight
- Independent auditors from certified regional authorities must evaluate a randomized minimum of 5% of all assessments annually.  
- Discrepancies exceeding 10% from verified market parity trigger mandatory reassessment and public notice.  
- All audit results must be published in the public registry to ensure transparency and maintain trust.  

## Valuation Dispute Process
If a buyer or seller disputes an assessed value:  
- The property enters a **Temporary Review Hold** before final closing.  
- Both parties submit documentation to an independent review board.  
- The final RACV may be adjusted within ±10% if material evidence of error exists.

## Fairness and Fraud Protection
- Artificial overvaluation by assessors, brokers, or financial institutions constitutes valuation fraud.  
- Individuals have the right to audit or appeal RACV assessments without penalty.  
- Any proven manipulation or suppression of valuation data leads to immediate license suspension and restitution obligations.

## Full Ownership Guarantee
- Ownership includes the right to occupy, transfer, and modify property—provided all modifications meet regional safety and environmental codes.  
- Ownership does *not* exempt individuals from community standards, blight laws, or affordability restrictions under this Act.  
- Property owners must maintain compliance with local and federal affordability standards to retain their ownership rights.
