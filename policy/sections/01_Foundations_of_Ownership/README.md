# SECTION 1 — FOUNDATIONS OF OWNERSHIP & HOUSING STABILITY

## 1.1 Purpose
Stabilize residential and land pricing by anchoring values to real inflation and verifiable improvements, not speculative escalation.

## 1.2 Evaluation Standard (Core Method)
Adjusted Value (RACV) = Base Price + (Cumulative Wage-Indexed Inflation × Eligible Years) + Documented Capital Improvements − Certified Habitability Repairs.

## 1.3 Assessment Integrity
Assessors must disclose methodology; use comps filtered for distortion; and apply repair deductions. Peer review every 3 years with citizen auditors. Systematic overstatements trigger penalties and retraining.

## 1.4 Blight & Neglect
Properties left derelict or used as unlicensed junkyards are subject to graduated orders, fines, and, if necessary, temporary receivership. If a parcel lies within an HOA, the HOA assumes interim maintenance (lawncare, exterior safety) until individual resale.

## 1.5 Full-Ownership Guarantee & Safeguard
Ownership conveys full control **subject to** public-interest, safety, environmental, and affordability laws in this Act. Permits remain required for new structures, major remodels, and utility connections; permitting shall be simplified, capped-cost, and non-discretionary. Anti-monopoly guard: no person or entity may accumulate holdings that materially restrict access or create scarcity in a local market.

## 1.6 HOA Accountability & Opt-Out
Owners may petition to opt out of non-transparent or non-performing HOAs; where <50% of lots are sold/occupied, HOA authority is limited to essential maintenance and financial transparency, subject to municipal oversight.

## 1.7 Fair Advertising Clause
Listings must appear on public, accessible portals; restricting exposure to private corporate channels violates equal-access and the buyer priority ladder.

## 1.8 Title Protection & Anti-Deed Fraud
Automatic title-lock enrollment at recording; verified owner contact before transfer; criminal penalties for forged deeds; expedited restoration processes for victims.

## 1.9 Easement & Long-Lease Buyout Safeguards
Buyouts must disclose lifetime value impact certified by an independent appraiser; include a 7-day cooling-off period; easements >20 years trigger valuation credits for tax/financing.
