# Definitions & Valuation (Core Methods)

**Purpose.** Tie prices to wages and real condition so affordability tracks incomes, not hype.

## §1.1 Terms
- **Original Purchase Price (OPP):** Price paid when last acquired at arm’s length (closing statement).  
- **Wage Index:** The time-weighted ratio of local median wages between the purchase year and now, with a hard cap at the simple wage ratio. *(Policy Dial)*  
- **Wage‑Indexed Value (WIV):** OPP × Wage Index + **Documented Improvements** (capital only; no routine maintenance).  
- **Repair‑Adjusted Current Value (RACV):** As‑is fair value **minus Required Repairs** to meet habitability/code.  
- **Applicable Value (AV):** **Lesser of WIV and RACV.**  
- **Permissible Variance (PV):** Narrow, documented leeway applied **after** AV is set:  
  - **Negotiation Margin (NM)** for sales *(Policy Dial: default 3–5%)*  
  - **Rent Tolerance Band (RTB)** for rents *(Policy Dial: default ±3%)*

## §1.2 Improvements that count
Capital items that extend life or capacity: structural, roof, envelope, systems, code-required work, accessibility, energy upgrades. DIY allowed with receipts. Decorative/maintenance (paint, cleaning, landscaping upkeep) do **not** increase WIV.

## §1.3 Required Repairs (for RACV)
Life-safety, envelope integrity, mechanical/electrical/plumbing, pest/mold remediation, code defects. Estimates use department cost guides; owner may submit verified bids.

## §1.4 Safeguards against appraisal gaming
- **Rotating assessor/inspector panels** with blind assignment.  
- **Transparent cost guides** published annually.  
- **Dual-inspection option:** owner or buyer may trigger a second inspection; AV uses the more conservative repair deduction.  
- **Conflict firewall:** assessors may not appraise properties they marketed, designed, or managed in last 3 years.  
- **Random audits:** ≥10% of valuations audited each year *(Policy Dial)*.

## §1.5 Appeals — Valuation Review Board (VRB)
Fast, paper‑first review within **45 days**. If owner prevails ≥2%, AV is corrected and any taxes/fees/rents/sale caps recalculated; over‑collections refunded with interest.

## §1.6 Penalties & transparency
Misstatements or cap evasion → rescission, restitution, and civil penalties; repeat actors face license suspension. De‑identified valuation data (inputs, ranges) published for accountability.

> **Universal Rule:** **Set AV = min(WIV, RACV).** Only then may NM/RTB apply. NM/RTB cannot offset missing repairs.
