All offers are time-stamped in a certified registry; auditable for shill/phantom bids.

## 2.2 Anti-Bot & Auto-Purchase Ban
Automated mass-purchase systems are prohibited; violations void the sale and trigger penalties.

## 2.3 Priority Ladder
Order: (1) local resident ≥2 years; (2) in-state resident; (3) domestic buyer; (4) nonprofit/co-op; (5) corporate buyer. Within a rung, first qualified application prevails.

Sellers must advertise through approved public channels reaching all priority rungs; exclusive corporate funnels are unlawful.
