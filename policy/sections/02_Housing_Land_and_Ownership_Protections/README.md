# Section 2 — Housing, Land, and Ownership Protections

## Purpose
This section preserves residential and land ownership fairness by ensuring that property, whether developed or vacant, is used productively and equitably.  
It safeguards residents from speculative manipulation, abandonment, or forced displacement through unfair market practices.

## Blight and Neglect Prevention
- Owners are required to maintain properties to basic habitability and safety standards.  
- If a property becomes abandoned or uninhabitable, it enters **Custodial Stewardship**, where a certified public authority or local land trust temporarily assumes maintenance until ownership is reestablished.  
- Failure to maintain a property within 18 months of official notice results in reassignment for redevelopment or rehabilitation.  
- For HOA-controlled areas, maintenance responsibility remains with the HOA until individual ownership transfer is complete.

## Homeowners Association (HOA) Protections
- Residents must be allowed to **opt out** of HOA jurisdiction when all debts and fees are cleared.  
- HOAs lose regulatory power if fewer than 60% of lots or homes remain unsold, ensuring they cannot indefinitely control unoccupied areas.  
- HOA boards must publicly post all budgets and expenditures.  
- Any HOA or developer that withholds ownership titles, restricts resale, or imposes unfair restrictions is subject to forfeiture of management rights.

## Rezoning and Land Reclassification
- When land use is rezoned (e.g., agricultural → commercial → residential), valuation adjustments must reflect the *original* zoning category for any buyback or compensation.  
- If a property’s zoning upgrade was initiated for speculative resale, the increase in value is reversed during sale or tax evaluation.  
- Local governments may retain a portion of rezoning profits for public housing development.

## Vacant and Unused Land
- Vacant land held for over 24 months without active improvement or agricultural use is subject to review and potential reassignment to local development trusts.  
- Owners must provide intent-to-develop documentation to avoid reassignment.  
- Parcels intentionally kept idle to restrict housing supply are subject to land-value taxation at up to 200% of their baseline rate.

## Resident Priority Access
- All for-sale properties must be listed on at least one **public access registry** available to local residents before being marketed to corporations or out-of-region buyers.  
- Listings must remain publicly available for 30 days before out-of-area offers are accepted.  
- Advertising only to corporations, private networks, or exclusive investment groups violates the Affordability Act’s equal access clause.
