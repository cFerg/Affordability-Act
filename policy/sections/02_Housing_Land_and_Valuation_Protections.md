SUMMARY:
Creates a regulated framework for housing and land valuation based on real costs, wage growth, and condition.
Introduces Regulated Assessed Current Value (RACV) to prevent price gouging and speculation.
Addresses vacancy, blight, rezoning windfalls, and unequal market access.
Ensures housing prices reflect reality rather than artificial scarcity.

## Section 2 — Housing, Land & Valuation Protections

## Plain-English Summary  
Housing prices should reflect real costs, real improvements, and real use — not speculation, artificial scarcity, or unchecked market manipulation. This section establishes fair valuation standards, prevents price gouging, curbs land hoarding, and ensures housing remains accessible to local residents.

## Legal-Style Provisions

### 2.1 Regulated Assessed Current Value (RACV)

**2.1.1 Baseline Valuation Standard**  
All residential property shall be assigned a **Regulated Assessed Current Value (RACV)** calculated as:
- original purchase or construction cost,
- plus approved inflation adjustments tied to wage growth,
- plus documented improvements,
- minus verified deterioration or deferred maintenance.

**2.1.2 Market Limitation Rule**  
Market comparables alone may not justify prices exceeding RACV limits.

---

### 2.2 Permissible Variance & Sale Caps

**2.2.1 Negotiation Allowance**  
Sellers may list property within a limited percentage above RACV to allow for:
- negotiation,
- assessment variance,
- localized demand.

**2.2.2 Absolute Price Ceiling**  
Under no circumstance may a sale exceed the RACV plus permissible variance unless purchased for verified personal occupancy by a priority buyer.

---

### 2.3 Anti-Speculation & Vacancy Controls

**2.3.1 Use Requirement**  
Residential land and housing may not be held vacant beyond defined thresholds without:
- legitimate renovation,
- or approved hardship exemption.

**2.3.2 Vacancy Enforcement**  
Extended vacancy may trigger:
- vacancy fees,
- compulsory listing,
- or public acquisition at regulated value.

---

### 2.4 Blight, Neglect & Valuation Adjustment

**2.4.1 Maintenance Obligation**  
Owners must maintain minimum habitability and safety standards regardless of occupancy.

**2.4.2 Repair-Based Valuation Reduction**  
RACV must be reduced by the documented cost required to restore habitability.

Assessors may not inflate value while ignoring required repairs.

---

### 2.5 Rezoning & Public Value Capture

**2.5.1 Original Zoning Baseline**  
Where rezoning occurs, valuation must reference the original zoning classification.

**2.5.2 Public Benefit Share**  
Value created through public rezoning may be partially recaptured for:
- housing development,
- infrastructure,
- affordability programs.

---

### 2.6 Advertising & Market Access Fairness

**2.6.1 Equal Exposure Requirement**  
Properties must be advertised in venues accessible to:
- local residents,
- individual buyers,
- non-corporate purchasers.

**2.6.2 Prohibited Targeting**  
Exclusive advertising to corporations or private investor networks violates priority access rules.

---

## Example Scenarios (Illustrative)

**Example 1: Price Gouging**  
A home purchased for $100,000 is listed at $300,000 without improvements.  
→ Sale is capped at RACV plus permissible variance.

**Example 2: Neglected Property**  
A home with mold and roof damage is assessed at full market value.  
→ Repair costs must reduce RACV.

**Example 3: Rezoned Land**  
Land value spikes after rezoning from agricultural to residential.  
→ Speculative uplift is restricted.

## Why This Section Exists

Unregulated housing markets:
- outpace wages,
- reward speculation,
- lock people out of ownership.

This section restores **price realism, local access, and accountability**.
