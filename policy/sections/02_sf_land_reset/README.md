# Single‑Family & Land Reset

## §2.1 Sale Price Cap
Final consideration ≤ **AV + NM** (downward unlimited). No side payments or “key money.” Closing costs cannot be used to exceed cap.

## §2.2 First‑Look & Owner‑Occupant Priority
- **First‑Look window** (e.g., 5 business days) open to: existing tenant intending to buy, first‑time buyer, local owner‑occupant, qualified nonprofit/CLT.  
- **Priority ladder** within First‑Look; tie‑breaker is **earliest verified registry timestamp**. No above‑cap escalations to break ties.

## §2.3 Land & Improvements
Land treated like housing; only **infrastructure** (utilities, grading, access, code-required environmental mitigation) counts as improvement. Speculative holding does not.

## §2.4 Trusts & Inheritance
Beneficial owner rules apply. Minors inherit with a maintenance duty carried by the trustee; public trust may step in for needed repairs with a lien capped at cost.

## §2.5 Mortgage/Deed of Trust Alignment
If AV reset < unpaid principal: servicer must offer (i) term extension, (ii) rate modification, or (iii) principal write‑down to AV without fresh credit pull; no negative credit reporting for accepting a reset.

## §2.6 Offer Integrity (cross‑refer §6)
Pre‑verification, anti‑bot, rate limits, beneficial‑owner consolidation, and public de‑identified logs are mandatory.

## §2.7 Closing & Fees
Admin/processing/title add‑ons capped; only truly optional services may be itemized. Fees pegged to **hours of local minimum wage** *(Policy Dial)*.

## §2.8 Enforcement
Overcharge → refund + 2× penalty; repeat → license discipline and suspension from registry.
