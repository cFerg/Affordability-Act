# Section 3 — Fair Market Participation and Offer Integrity

## Purpose
To ensure that every person has equal opportunity to participate in real estate and asset markets without unfair competition or artificial price escalation.

## Certified Offer Registry (COR)
- All property, rental, or lease offers must be logged in the **Certified Offer Registry**, a publicly accessible database managed by the Office of Affordability Oversight.  
- Each bid is timestamped and digitally verified to prevent falsified competition.  
- Bidders may withdraw offers within 48 hours without penalty.  
- Sellers must confirm final accepted bids through COR before closing.

## Anti-Bot and Automation Controls
- Automated bidding, offer-sniping, and AI-based price manipulation tools are strictly prohibited.  
- Companies using automated investment systems must register their software with the Office of Affordability Oversight.  
- Violations result in suspension of brokerage or listing privileges for 12 months minimum.

## Digital and Physical Scope
- The same affordability rules apply to both physical property and digital property (including domain names, digital land parcels, or online rental assets).  
- Digital assets sold through blockchain or online platforms must follow the same registry, taxation, and verification protocols as physical assets.

## Equal Advertising Reach
- Listings must appear on at least two public registries or one state-certified listing platform accessible by all residents.  
- Marketing exclusively to corporate or investor entities violates equal access principles.  
- Private sale exceptions (family transfers, inheritance) are exempt.

## Fairness in Bidding and Negotiation
- Sellers may not claim “competing offers” unless documented in the COR.  
- “Bidding wars” are capped at 10% above the listed RACV; anything higher must be reviewed for legitimacy.  
- If multiple buyers meet the same offer threshold, priority follows the **Resident Priority Ladder**:
  1. Local full-time residents  
  2. In-state residents  
  3. Domestic buyers  
  4. International or corporate entities
