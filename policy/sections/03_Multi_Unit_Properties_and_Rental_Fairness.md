SUMMARY:
Renters should not be forced to subsidize vacancy, speculation, or artificial scarcity. Rental pricing must reflect real costs, real occupancy, and real maintenance — not market manipulation. This section ensures fair rent calculation, prevents abuse in multi-unit properties, and regulates short- and long-term lodging to protect affordability.

## Section 3 — Rentals, Multi-Unit Housing & Lodging

## Section 3 Purpose  
Renters should not be forced to subsidize vacancy, speculation, or artificial scarcity. Rental pricing must reflect real costs, real occupancy, and real maintenance — not market manipulation. This section ensures fair rent calculation, prevents abuse in multi-unit properties, and regulates short- and long-term lodging to protect affordability.

## Legal-Style Provisions

### 3.1 Base Rent & Cost-Based Pricing

**3.1.1 Rental Baseline Standard**  
Rent for residential units shall be calculated from:

- Regulated Assessed Current Value (RACV) of the property, plus  
- Approved inflation adjustments, plus  
- Documented operating costs, divided by  
- Total habitable units.

**3.1.2 Prohibition on Market-Only Rent Setting**  
Rental prices may not be justified solely by market rates where those rates exceed cost-based calculations.

#### Summary — 3.1 Base Rent & Cost-Based Pricing
This subsection ensures rent is anchored to real ownership cost, verified operating expenses, and habitable unit count—rather than speculative market rates.

#### Examples
Example: A landlord cites “market comps” to raise rent despite stable costs and no improvements.
→ Prohibited when market exceeds cost-based rent.

Example: A building’s operating costs rise due to verified repairs and insurance increases.
→ Cost-based rent may adjust only by documented amounts.

#### Why this subsection exists
Market-only rent setting enables coordinated rent inflation, punishes tenants for scarcity they didn’t create, and disconnects rent from real cost.

### 3.2 Unit-Based Allocation & Fair Distribution

**3.2.1 Proportional Rent Allocation**  
Rent must be apportioned fairly between units based on:
- square footage, or
- bedroom count, or
- a documented hybrid of both.

Landlords must choose one allocation method, and apply it consistently, unless it is disclosed and justfied.

**3.2.2 Transparency Requirement**  
Landlords must provide tenants with a clear rent breakdown upon request, showing how rent was calculated.

#### Summary — 3.2 Unit-Based Allocation & Fair Distribution
This subsection prevents arbitrary pricing between units by requiring a consistent allocation method based on size and/or capacity.

#### Examples
Example: A 4-bedroom unit and a 2-bedroom unit are priced identically with no justification.
→ Must be allocated proportionally.

Example: Landlord uses a hybrid method but cannot explain the weighting.
→ Violates transparency requirement.

#### Why this subsection exists
Unequal unit pricing creates hidden discrimination, encourages gouging of high-need households, and makes rent incomprehensible and unchallengeable.

### 3.3 Vacancy & Empty-Unit Protections

**3.3.1 No Vacancy Cost Shifting**  
Occupied tenants may not be charged higher rent to offset:
- vacant units,
- unsold units,
- or speculative withholding.

Vacancy costs are the responsibility of the property owner.

**3.3.2 Chronic Vacancy Review**  
Multi-unit properties with persistent vacancy may be subject to:
- rent caps,
- compulsory unit offering,
- or acquisition at regulated value.

“Persistent vacancy” = vacancy rate above X% over Y months or units held off-market intentionally.

#### Summary — 3.3 Vacancy & Empty-Unit Protections
This subsection prevents owners from shifting vacancy losses onto paying tenants and discourages intentional withholding of habitable units.

#### Examples
Example: 40 units exist, 15 occupied, and rent increases are imposed to “make up the difference.”
→ Prohibited; vacancy costs remain with the owner.

Example: Units are left unrented despite being habitable to create scarcity.
→ Triggers chronic vacancy review and corrective measures.

#### Why this subsection exists
Vacancy cost-shifting makes tenants subsidize speculation and rewards artificial scarcity, driving rents upward without improving housing.

### 3.4 Maintenance, Habitability & Rent Adjustment

**3.4.1 Habitability Standard**  
Rental units must meet minimum safety and habitability requirements.

**3.4.2 Rent Reduction for Defects**  
Where deficiencies exist:
- rent must be reduced proportionally until resolved,
- repair costs may not be passed through retroactively.

Rent reductions are automatic once verified (inspection report / written notice + failure to cure), to prevent stalling.

#### Summary — 3.4 Maintenance, Habitability & Rent Adjustment
This subsection ties rent to livability by requiring repairs and reducing rent when verified defects persist.

#### Examples
Example: A unit has mold and leaks; landlord delays repairs while collecting full rent.
→ Rent must be reduced until corrected.

Example: Landlord attempts to charge tenants for deferred maintenance retroactively.
→ Prohibited.

#### Why this subsection exists
Without a rent consequence, neglect becomes profitable and tenants are forced to pay full price for unsafe housing.

### 3.5 Student Housing & Boarding

**3.5.1 Equal Treatment of Student Housing**  
Student housing, boarding houses, and dormitory-style rentals are subject to the same pricing and habitability rules as standard rentals.

**3.5.2 Anti-Exploitation Rule**  
Institutions or landlords may not inflate rent based on:
- enrollment status,
- academic year,
- or forced proximity to campus.

Student status may not be used as a proxy for seasonal surge pricing.

#### Summary — 3.5 Student Housing & Boarding
This subsection prevents student housing and dorm-style rentals from being treated as a captive market with inflated pricing.

#### Examples
Example: Rent near a university increases only during the academic year.
→ Prohibited student-based inflation.

Example: A boarding-style lease charges hidden fees tied to enrollment periods.
→ Must follow the same cost-based transparency rules.

#### Why this subsection exists
Students often lack bargaining power and are forced into proximity-based housing, making them easy targets for predictable price manipulation.

### 3.6 Campgrounds, RV Parks & Long-Term Lodging

**3.6.1 Lodging Classification**  
Campgrounds, RV parks, and extended-stay lodging serving long-term residents are treated as residential housing for pricing purposes.

Long-term = Individuals are at a given location for 30+ days, or it is listed as a primary residence.

**3.6.2 Cost-Aligned Pricing**  
Rates must reflect:
- land value,
- provided utilities,
- amenities offered,
and may not exceed reasonable residential equivalents.

#### Summary — 3.6 Campgrounds, RV Parks & Long-Term Lodging
This subsection prevents long-term residents from being charged exploitative “tourism pricing” when a campground or RV park functions as housing.

#### Examples
Example: An RV park serving month-to-month residents raises rates like a hotel during peak season.
→ Treated as residential; cost-aligned caps apply.

Example: A long-term campground adds mandatory fees unrelated to utilities or amenities.
→ Prohibited unless cost-justified and disclosed.

#### Why this subsection exists
When lodging becomes a de facto home, unstable “vacation pricing” becomes displacement pressure and increases homelessness risk.
