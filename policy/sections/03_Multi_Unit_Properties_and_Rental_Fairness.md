## Section 3 — Rentals, Multi-Unit Housing & Lodging

## Plain-English Summary  
Renters should not be forced to subsidize vacancy, speculation, or artificial scarcity. Rental pricing must reflect real costs, real occupancy, and real maintenance — not market manipulation. This section ensures fair rent calculation, prevents abuse in multi-unit properties, and regulates short- and long-term lodging to protect affordability.

## Legal-Style Provisions

### 3.1 Base Rent & Cost-Based Pricing

**3.1.1 Rental Baseline Standard**  
Rent for residential units shall be calculated from:

- Regulated Assessed Current Value (RACV) of the property, plus  
- Approved inflation adjustments, plus  
- Documented operating costs, divided by  
- Total habitable units.

**3.1.2 Prohibition on Market-Only Rent Setting**  
Rental prices may not be justified solely by market rates where those rates exceed cost-based calculations.

---

### 3.2 Unit-Based Allocation & Fair Distribution

**3.2.1 Proportional Rent Allocation**  
Rent must be apportioned fairly between units based on:
- square footage, or
- bedroom count, or
- a documented hybrid of both.

**3.2.2 Transparency Requirement**  
Landlords must provide tenants with a clear rent breakdown upon request, showing how rent was calculated.

---

### 3.3 Vacancy & Empty-Unit Protections

**3.3.1 No Vacancy Cost Shifting**  
Occupied tenants may not be charged higher rent to offset:
- vacant units,
- unsold units,
- or speculative withholding.

Vacancy costs are the responsibility of the property owner.

**3.3.2 Chronic Vacancy Review**  
Multi-unit properties with persistent vacancy may be subject to:
- rent caps,
- compulsory unit offering,
- or acquisition at regulated value.

---

### 3.4 Maintenance, Habitability & Rent Adjustment

**3.4.1 Habitability Standard**  
Rental units must meet minimum safety and habitability requirements.

**3.4.2 Rent Reduction for Defects**  
Where deficiencies exist:
- rent must be reduced proportionally until resolved,
- repair costs may not be passed through retroactively.

---

### 3.5 Student Housing & Boarding

**3.5.1 Equal Treatment of Student Housing**  
Student housing, boarding houses, and dormitory-style rentals are subject to the same pricing and habitability rules as standard rentals.

**3.5.2 Anti-Exploitation Rule**  
Institutions or landlords may not inflate rent based on:
- enrollment status,
- academic year,
- or forced proximity to campus.

---

### 3.6 Campgrounds, RV Parks & Long-Term Lodging

**3.6.1 Lodging Classification**  
Campgrounds, RV parks, and extended-stay lodging serving long-term residents are treated as residential housing for pricing purposes.

**3.6.2 Cost-Aligned Pricing**  
Rates must reflect:
- land value,
- provided utilities,
- amenities offered,
and may not exceed reasonable residential equivalents.

---

## Example Scenarios (Illustrative)

**Example 1: Vacancy Cost Abuse**  
An apartment building has 40 units, but only 15 are rented. Remaining tenants see rent increases.  
→ This is prohibited. Vacancy costs belong to the owner.

**Example 2: Unequal Unit Pricing**  
A landlord charges identical rent for a 2-bedroom and a 4-bedroom unit.  
→ Rent must be proportionally allocated.

**Example 3: Student Rent Inflation**  
A landlord raises rent only during the academic year near a university.  
→ Seasonal student-based inflation is prohibited.

## Why This Section Exists

Rent inflation driven by vacancy, speculation, and unequal pricing:
- punishes tenants,
- destabilizes communities,
- and accelerates housing insecurity.

This section restores **fairness, transparency, and cost realism** to rental housing.
