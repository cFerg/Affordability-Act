# SECTION 3 â€” PAYMENT INTEGRITY, VEHICLES & COMMERCE FAIRNESS

## 3.1 Payment Integrity (All Housing/Lodging Contracts)
At least one low-fee, traceable electronic method must be accepted; itemized receipts required; cash-only mandates banned except during verified outages.

### 3.1a Digital & Non-Digital Access Parity
For notices, payments, registries, and appeals, provide both online and accessible non-digital alternatives.

## 3.2 Multi-Payment Contract Oversight
Lease-to-own, rent-to-own, and financing agreements must issue automated receipts and clear amortization tables; junk fee pass-throughs are void.

## 3.3 Dealer Add-On Opt-Out
Consumers may decline any optional add-on without impact to approval, term, or rate. A base vehicle price must be disclosed before financing.

## 3.4 Motor-Vehicle Valuation Reversion
Resale and insurance valuations derive from MSRP adjusted for age, mileage, and condition tiers. Antiques/rarities may use certified premium tiers with documentation.

## 3.5 Temporary Registration Accountability & Transparency
Temp tags require scannable public verification (QR/NFC) with issuance/expiry, dealer ID, and basic vehicle data; dealers are capped to inventory-linked issuance and audited. Operating with expired/unverifiable temp tags beyond 10 days is unregistered operation. Cross-state verification required; hardship extensions available where agency delay is documented.

## 3.6 Right-to-Repair
Manufacturers must provide diagnostics, parts, and documentation to independent repairers at fair cost; anti-circumvention of repair is prohibited.

## 3.7 Fair Repossession Practices
Grace periods, capped repossession fees, and surplus-proceeds refunds are mandatory; buy-here-pay-here schemes face enhanced scrutiny.

## 3.8 Fair Banking Transaction Sequencing
Reordering transactions to increase overdraft fees is prohibited; default behavior is decline-at-zero with a single transparent fee cap.
