# Rezoned Properties & Value Capture

## §3.1 Baseline by Original Zoning
Rezoning alone cannot raise AV. Baseline remains OPP and OPP‑era zoning until physical improvements are constructed and inspected.

## §3.2 Build‑Out Exception
When built consistent with new zoning, add **verified development costs** (hard + permitted soft costs) to WIV; still subject to **min(WIV, RACV)**.

## §3.3 Rezoning Dividend
A majority share *(Policy Dial: e.g., 60%)* of rezoning‑created land value is captured to a local Housing & Infrastructure Fund, payable at certificate of occupancy or sale, whichever comes first.

## §3.4 Anti‑Flip Hold
Rezoned but unbuilt parcels held >24 months incur a **holding surtax** or must auction at **AV** to qualified builders/CLTs.

## §3.5 Residential vs. Commercial
Mixed‑use splits pro‑rata by floor area; residential portions follow housing caps; commercial portions follow a parallel wage/repair rule with an NM suited to commercial markets *(Policy Dial)*.
