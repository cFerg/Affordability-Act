# SECTION 4 â€” COMMUNAL, UTILITY & INFRASTRUCTURE STANDARDS

## 4.1 Timeshares & Fractional Interests
Resale and annual fees tie to RACV of the underlying asset and the actual usage right; perpetual escalators detached from cost are unlawful; clear exit paths required.

## 4.2 Campgrounds, RV Parks & Short-Term Lodging
Long-stay pricing = land RACV + shared-service costs + modest margin; amenity/seasonal premiums allowed if real and disclosed.

## 4.3 Fiber-First Infrastructure
All new construction must install fiber-optic conduit or equivalent high-speed broadband alongside power/water; legacy copper qualifies only where fiber is physically impractical.

## 4.4 Minimum Service Baseline
Each new dwelling must have broadband sufficient for remote work, education, and telehealth; the local standard is published by the utility board.

## 4.5 Utility Volatility Controls
No more than one rate change per quarter; increases > inflation +2% require verified cost justification and a 60-day notice with appeal rights; seasonal surcharges must be smoothed over the year.

## 4.6 Baseline ISP Plan & Regional Equity
ISPs must offer a baseline plan (e.g., 25 Mbps or higher, reviewed periodically) at uniform rates across ZIPs in the service region; last-mile subsidies flow from the Affordability Fund, not consumer surcharges.
