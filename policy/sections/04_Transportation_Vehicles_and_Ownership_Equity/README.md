# Section 4 — Transportation, Vehicles, and Ownership Equity

## Purpose
To extend affordability protections into transportation and automotive markets by ensuring fairness in production, purchase, and maintenance costs.

## Fair Vehicle Valuation
- Vehicle prices must reflect base manufacturer cost, inflation, and condition adjustments.  
- Used vehicles cannot be priced higher than new equivalent models unless classified as rare or antique.  
- “Collector” or “heritage” vehicles are exempt but must be transparently labeled as non-essential assets.

## Dealer Practices
- All dealership fees must be itemized and disclosed at the point of sale.  
- “Market adjustment” or “availability surcharge” fees are prohibited for any new production vehicle.  
- Lease buyouts and used-car valuations must be based on RACV-equivalent calculations.

## Right to Repair
- Manufacturers must provide diagnostic tools, replacement parts, and repair documentation at reasonable cost to licensed mechanics and owners.  
- Proprietary software locks that restrict repairability are prohibited under this Act.  
- Refusal to sell replacement parts constitutes unfair trade practice.

## Tariff Exemptions
- Building materials and components for housing or vehicles may be exempt from tariffs when those tariffs directly raise end-user affordability costs.  
- The Department of Commerce will maintain a list of **Affordability-Critical Materials** eligible for exemption.

## Registration and Ownership Verification
- Temporary or paper license plates may not exceed 60 days of validity.  
- Repeated registration evasion or use of fraudulent plates triggers license suspension and asset seizure.
