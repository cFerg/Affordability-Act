<!--
SUMMARY:
This section addresses systemic affordability failures in vehicle pricing, registration, insurance, fuel quality, and emergency transportation.  
It prevents speculative pricing, abusive dealer practices, registration loopholes, insurance volatility, and hidden efficiency losses that collectively raise the cost of transportation beyond its real economic value.

Reliable transportation is a prerequisite for employment, healthcare access, and daily life. When vehicle systems are exploited, affordability across all other sectors collapses.

## Section 4 — Vehicles, Registration & Transportation Costs

## Section 4 Purpose  
This section addresses systemic affordability failures in vehicle pricing, registration, insurance, fuel quality, and emergency transportation.  
It prevents speculative pricing, abusive dealer practices, registration loopholes, insurance volatility, and hidden efficiency losses that collectively raise the cost of transportation beyond its real economic value.

Reliable transportation is a prerequisite for employment, healthcare access, and daily life. When vehicle systems are exploited, affordability across all other sectors collapses.

## Legal-Style Provisions

### 4.1 Vehicle Price Reversion & Valuation

**4.1.1 Vehicle Baseline Value**  
Motor vehicles shall be valued based on:
- original manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP), or
- original purchase price if lower,
adjusted for:
- documented depreciation,
- verified improvements,
- condition and mileage.

**4.1.2 Prohibition on Speculative Pricing**  
Used vehicles may not be sold at or above the current new-vehicle MSRP unless classified as:
- antique,
- collectible,
- or rare by documented criteria.

#### Summary — 4.1  
This subsection ensures vehicle prices reflect real value rather than artificial scarcity, speculative resale, or opaque markups. It ties pricing to objective depreciation and use rather than market manipulation.

#### Examples  
• A used vehicle with 60,000 miles is priced higher than its original MSRP due to “market demand.”  
→ Price reversion limits apply.

• A dealer inflates prices based on regional scarcity rather than condition or mileage.  
→ Valuation must revert to standardized depreciation metrics.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Vehicles rapidly depreciate in real-world use. Allowing speculative pricing distorts affordability, traps workers in debt, and turns transportation into a profit-extraction mechanism rather than a utility.

### 4.2 Dealer & Resale Practices

**4.2.1 Anti-Gouging Rule**  
Dealers and resellers may not:
- inflate prices due to supply manipulation,
- impose mandatory add-ons unrelated to safety,
- disguise price increases as fees.

**4.2.2 Transparent Pricing Requirement**  
All vehicle listings must display:
- base price,
- fees itemized individually,
- total out-the-door price.

#### Summary — 4.2  
This subsection prevents predatory dealer behavior, hidden fees, and resale manipulation that artificially inflate vehicle prices beyond disclosed value.

#### Examples  
• A dealer advertises a low vehicle price but adds mandatory “market adjustments” at signing.  
→ Prohibited pricing practice.

• A reseller flips vehicles repeatedly to inflate market comparables.  
→ Anti-manipulation safeguards apply.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Dealer opacity and resale manipulation create false market signals, eroding trust and forcing consumers to overpay for essential transportation.

### 4.3 Temporary & Paper Registration Abuse

**4.3.1 Registration Integrity**  
Temporary and paper license plates may only be issued:
- once per vehicle sale,
- for a strictly limited duration.

**4.3.2 Prohibition on Serial Temporary Plates**  
Repeated issuance of temporary plates for the same vehicle constitutes:
- registration fraud,
- and grounds for fines or suspension.

#### Summary — 4.3  
This subsection prevents the misuse of temporary registrations to evade taxes, fees, insurance requirements, and enforcement accountability.

#### Examples  
• A vehicle operates for months on successive temporary plates.  
→ Registration abuse enforcement applies.

• A seller repeatedly issues temporary tags to avoid formal registration.  
→ Civil and administrative penalties apply.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Temporary registration abuse undermines road safety, insurance systems, and public revenue, shifting costs onto compliant drivers.

### 4.4 Insurance Fairness & Alignment

**4.4.1 Value-Aligned Premiums**  
Vehicle insurance premiums must reasonably correlate with:
- vehicle value,
- driver history,
- actual risk exposure.

**4.4.2 Prohibition on Non-Event Increases**  
Premiums may not be increased due to:
- general inflation claims alone,
- industry-wide losses unrelated to the insured.

#### Summary — 4.4  
This subsection ensures vehicle insurance premiums align with actual risk, vehicle value, and verified changes—not arbitrary pricing volatility.

#### Examples  
• Insurance premiums increase despite no claims, violations, or valuation change.  
→ Increase requires documented justification.

• A vehicle’s insured value decreases, but premiums rise.  
→ Misalignment prohibited.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Unregulated insurance volatility acts as a hidden tax on transportation, punishing safe drivers and destabilizing household budgets.

### 4.5 Emergency Transportation Protections

**4.5.1 Public Coverage of Emergency Transport**  
Emergency medical transportation required to preserve life or safety shall be covered by:
- public emergency services,
- or public insurance mechanisms.

**4.5.2 No Surprise Transport Billing**  
Individuals may not be billed out-of-pocket for emergency transport beyond standardized public rates.

Emergency transport billing must be transparent, standardized, and capped. Patients may not be charged undisclosed, out-of-network, or post-hoc “balance bills” where transport was obtained under emergency conditions.

Any supplemental billing beyond standardized rates must be directed to public funding pools, insurer negotiations, or provider reimbursement mechanisms rather than the individual patient.

#### Summary — 4.5  
This subsection ensures emergency medical transportation is treated as a public safety service, not a financial penalty.

#### Examples  
• An individual is billed thousands for an ambulance during a medical emergency.  
→ Emergency transport must be publicly covered.

• A patient has no ability to consent to transport provider choice.  
→ Surprise billing protections apply.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Emergency transport is involuntary by nature. Charging individuals for unavoidable, life-saving services creates unjust financial harm.

### 4.6 Fuel Quality & Efficiency Protection

**4.6.1 Fuel Quality Disclosure**  
Fuel retailers must disclose:
- ethanol content,
- additive levels,
- and energy density ranges.

**4.6.2 Efficiency Parity Requirement**  
Fuel sold at equivalent prices must provide comparable energy output.

Discount programs may not be used to mask reduced fuel quality.

**4.6.3 Prohibited Degradation Practices**  
It is unlawful to:
- dilute fuel beyond disclosed standards,
- substitute lower-efficiency blends at standard pricing,
- or conceal efficiency loss through marketing programs.

**4.6.4 Enforcement & Remedies**  
Demonstrated efficiency loss resulting in increased consumer fuel costs may trigger:
- restitution,
- civil penalties,
- or class action eligibility.

#### Summary — 4.6  
This subsection prevents fuel quality degradation, misleading discounts, and efficiency manipulation that quietly increase transportation costs.

#### Examples  
• A station advertises discounted fuel that results in reduced mileage.  
→ Quality parity enforcement applies.

• Fuel additives or dilution reduce efficiency without disclosure.  
→ Prohibited practice.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Consumers pay for transportation by distance, not volume. Hidden efficiency losses act as covert price increases and undermine affordability.
