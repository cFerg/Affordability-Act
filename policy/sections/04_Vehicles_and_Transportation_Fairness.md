# 🚗 Vehicles & Transportation  
## Section 4 — Vehicles, Registration & Transportation Costs

## Plain-English Summary  
Transportation is a necessity, not a luxury. Vehicle prices, registration practices, and transportation-related costs must reflect real value and real use — not artificial scarcity, dealer manipulation, or insurance inflation. This section ensures fair vehicle pricing, curbs registration abuse, and protects access to essential transportation.

## Legal-Style Provisions

### 4.1 Vehicle Price Reversion & Valuation

adjusted for:
- documented depreciation,
- verified improvements,
- condition and mileage.

**4.1.2 Prohibition on Speculative Pricing**  
Used vehicles may not be sold at or above the current new-vehicle MSRP unless classified as:
- antique,

- or rare by documented criteria.

---

### 4.2 Dealer & Resale Practices

**4.2.1 Anti-Gouging Rule**  
Dealers and resellers may not:
- inflate prices due to supply manipulation,
- impose mandatory add-ons unrelated to safety,
- disguise price increases as fees.

**4.2.2 Transparent Pricing Requirement**  
All vehicle listings must display:
- base price,
- fees itemized individually,
- total out-the-door price.

---

### 4.3 Temporary & Paper Registration Abuse

**4.3.1 Registration Integrity**  
Temporary and paper license plates may only be issued:
- once per vehicle sale,
- for a strictly limited duration.

**4.3.2 Prohibition on Serial Temporary Plates**  
Repeated issuance of temporary plates for the same vehicle constitutes:
- registration fraud,
- and grounds for fines or suspension.

---

### 4.4 Insurance Fairness & Alignment

**4.4.1 Value-Aligned Premiums**  
Vehicle insurance premiums must reasonably correlate with:
- vehicle value,
- driver history,
- actual risk exposure.

**4.4.2 Prohibition on Non-Event Increases**  
Premiums may not be increased due to:
- general inflation claims alone,
- industry-wide losses unrelated to the insured.

---

### 4.5 Emergency Transportation Protections

**4.5.1 Public Coverage of Emergency Transport**  
Emergency medical transportation required to preserve life or safety shall be covered by:
- public emergency services,
- or public insurance mechanisms.

**4.5.2 No Surprise Transport Billing**  
Individuals may not be billed out-of-pocket for emergency transport beyond standardized public rates.

---

## Example Scenarios (Illustrative)

**Example 1: Used Car Inflation**  
A used vehicle with high mileage is priced near the cost of a new model.  
→ This violates valuation and depreciation standards.

**Example 2: Paper Plate Abuse**  
A driver repeatedly uses temporary plates to avoid registration fees.  
→ This constitutes fraud and triggers enforcement.

**Example 3: Emergency Ambulance Ride**  
An individual is billed thousands for a mandatory ambulance ride.  
→ Charges beyond standardized public rates are prohibited.

## Why This Section Exists

Transportation costs are a major driver of financial instability.  
Unchecked pricing and insurance abuse:
- trap workers,
- block access to employment,
- and punish compliance.

This section restores **fair value, transparency, and accountability** to transportation.
