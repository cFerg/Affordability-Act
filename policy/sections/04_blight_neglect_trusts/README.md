# Blight, Neglect, Trusts & Inherited Property
<!-- SUMMARY
Sets a duty to maintain habitability and exterior standards; repair costs reduce RACV until cured to end “profit from neglect.” Trusts/estates receive grace periods and a maintenance-only standard (esp. with minor heirs) while preventing trusts from parking properties vacant.

## §4.1 Vacancy & Blight
- **Vacant** >12 months or **unsafe** conditions trigger notices.  
- **Chronic blight** (>24 months or 2+ serious violations) → compulsory remediation or **conveyance to land bank** at AV.

## §4.2 Junkyard Misuse
Outdoor storage/junkyard operations in residential zones incur escalating fines and corrective orders; failure to cure may lead to compulsory sale at AV.

## §4.3 Trusts & Estates
Trustee owes a **maintenance duty**; if minors/disabled beneficiaries cannot fund repairs, the public trust may front repairs with a capped lien; property is not seized solely due to beneficiary age.

## §4.4 Due Process
Clear notices, cure timelines, right to VRB appeal, and judicial review. Hardship plans available; liens capped at documented repair costs plus modest admin *(Policy Dial)*.

## §4.5 Enforcement
- **Prohibited:** Chronic neglect past cure timeline; misuse as junkyard; trustee failure to maintain.
- **Remedies:** Abatement orders; fines per day (Tier I–II); transfer to land bank after due process; trustees personally liable for preventable deterioration against trust corpus (dial).
- **Protections:** No seizure solely due to minor beneficiary status.
