## Section 5 — Employment, Wage Baselines & Worker Protections

## Plain-English Summary  
Anyone working full time should be able to afford basic living costs without relying on debt or public assistance. Employment agreements must be honored, wages protected, and job loss handled with fairness and accountability. This section establishes wage baselines, bans abusive employment practices, and safeguards workers from coercive displacement.

## Legal-Style Provisions

### 5.1 Minimum Wage Redefinition & Baseline

**5.1.1 Full-Time Affordability Standard**  
The minimum wage shall be defined as the hourly rate required for a full-time worker to reasonably afford:
- housing appropriate to the local area,
- basic food and nutrition,
- essential utilities,
- transportation,
- healthcare coverage,
- and modest emergency savings.

**5.1.2 Multi-State Employment Rule**  
For workers employed across multiple states:
- the applicable minimum wage shall be the **highest** of:
  - the federal baseline,
  - any state minimum where work is performed.

---

### 5.2 Wage Contract Integrity

**5.2.1 Non-Reduction Clause**  
Signed wage agreements may not be reduced below the agreed rate within a defined protection period unless:
- initiated by the worker, or
- justified by documented hardship and mutual consent.

**5.2.2 Retroactive Wage Protection**  
Employers may not retroactively alter pay rates or hours worked.

---

### 5.3 Constructive Discharge Prohibition

**5.3.1 Absolute Ban**  
Constructive discharge — actions intended to force a worker to quit — is prohibited.

This includes:
- sudden wage cuts,
- hostile scheduling,
- forced relocations,
- deliberate duty reassignment designed to cause resignation.

**5.3.2 Classification as Involuntary Separation**  
Any separation resulting from constructive discharge shall be treated as:
- an employer-initiated layoff,
- fully eligible for unemployment and protections.

---

### 5.4 Layoff Notice & Unemployment Access

**5.4.1 Minimum Notice Requirement**  
Employers must provide advance notice of layoffs or mass reductions except in verified emergencies.

**5.4.2 Anti-Circumvention Rule**  
Employers may not restructure roles, schedules, or conditions to:
- evade unemployment liability,
- force voluntary resignation in name only.

---

### 5.5 Tipped Wage Reform

**5.5.1 Wage Floor Requirement**  
Tipped workers must receive the full minimum wage **before tips**.

Tips:
- belong exclusively to the worker,
- may not be counted toward wage minimums.

**5.5.2 Back Pay Calculation**  
If wages fall below minimum:
- back pay shall equal the difference between minimum wage and base wage,
- calculated independently of tips received.

---

### 5.6 Shift Timing & Worker Health

**5.6.1 Minimum Rest Periods**  
Employers must provide a minimum rest interval between shifts unless:
- adequate sleeping accommodations are provided,
- or emergency services justify extended shifts.

---

## Example Scenarios (Illustrative)

**Example 1: Constructive Discharge**  
An employer cuts an employee’s hours and reassigns duties to force resignation.  
→ This is treated as a layoff with full unemployment eligibility.

**Example 2: Tipped Wage Abuse**  
A server earns strong tips but is paid below minimum wage hourly.  
→ Employer owes back pay regardless of tip totals.

**Example 3: Multi-State Worker**  
A worker commutes between states with different minimum wages.  
→ The highest applicable wage applies.

## Why This Section Exists

Wage suppression and job instability:
- fuel housing insecurity,
- increase reliance on assistance,
- and undermine dignity of work.

This section ensures **work provides stability**, not precarity.
