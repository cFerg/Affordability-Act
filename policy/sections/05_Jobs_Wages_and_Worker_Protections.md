## Legal-Style Provisions

### 5.1 Minimum Wage Redefinition & Baseline

**5.1.1 Full-Time Affordability Standard**  
The minimum wage shall be defined as the hourly rate required for a full-time worker to reasonably afford:
- housing appropriate to the local area,
- basic food and nutrition,
- essential utilities,
- transportation,
- healthcare coverage,
- and modest emergency savings.

**5.1.2 Multi-State Employment Rule**  
For workers employed across multiple states:
- the applicable minimum wage shall be the **highest** of:
  - the federal baseline,
  - any state minimum where work is performed.

#### Summary — 5.1 Minimum Wage Redefinition & Baseline
This subsection establishes a wage floor that enables full-time workers to afford basic necessities, including housing, food, utilities, transportation, healthcare, and modest emergency savings. It also clarifies how minimum wage applies across multiple states.

#### Examples
• A worker in a high-cost state earns only the federal minimum wage.  
→ The higher applicable state wage applies.

• A remote employee works in two states with different minimums.  
→ The highest applicable minimum wage applies.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Tying minimum wage to real living costs prevents working full-time from being a pathway to poverty and housing insecurity.

### 5.2 Wage Contract Integrity

**5.2.1 Non-Reduction Clause**  
Signed wage agreements may not be reduced below the agreed rate within a defined protection period unless:
- initiated by the worker, or
- justified by documented hardship and mutual consent.

**5.2.2 Retroactive Wage Protection**  
Employers may not retroactively alter pay rates or hours worked.

#### Summary — 5.2 Wage Contract Integrity
This subsection prevents employers from reducing agreed wages or altering pay retroactively without worker consent or documented hardship justification.

#### Examples
• An employer lowers a signed wage rate mid-year without consent.  
→ Non-reduction protections apply.

• Hours worked are retroactively changed to reduce pay.  
→ Retroactive wage alterations are prohibited.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Enforceable wage agreements protect workers’ financial planning and prevent arbitrary or abusive employer practices.

### 5.3 Constructive Discharge Prohibition

**5.3.1 Absolute Ban**  
Constructive discharge — actions intended to force a worker to quit — is prohibited.

This includes:
- sudden wage cuts,
- hostile scheduling,
- forced relocations,
- deliberate duty reassignment designed to cause resignation.

**5.3.2 Classification as Involuntary Separation**  
Any separation resulting from constructive discharge shall be treated as:
- an employer-initiated layoff,
- fully eligible for unemployment and protections.

#### Summary — 5.3 Constructive Discharge Prohibition
This subsection prohibits workplace actions designed to force an employee to quit, such as sudden wage cuts, hostile scheduling, forced relocations, or deliberate reassignment of duties.

#### Examples
• An employer cuts hours and changes responsibilities with the aim of prompting resignation.  
→ Constructive discharge protections apply.

• An employee quits due to unreasonable scheduling designed to destabilize income.  
→ Separation is treated as employer-initiated.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Protecting workers from covert termination tactics preserves access to unemployment benefits and prevents hidden layoffs.

### 5.4 Layoff Notice & Unemployment Access

**5.4.1 Minimum Notice Requirement**  
Employers must provide advance notice of layoffs or mass reductions except in verified emergencies.

**5.4.2 Anti-Circumvention Rule**  
Employers may not restructure roles, schedules, or conditions to:
- evade unemployment liability,
- force voluntary resignation in name only.

#### Summary — 5.4 Layoff Notice & Unemployment Access
This subsection requires advance notice for layoffs and prohibits restructuring designed to circumvent unemployment obligations.

#### Examples
• A company reorganizes job duties to eliminate positions without formal layoffs.  
→ Anti-circumvention enforcement applies.

• Mass layoffs occur without required advance notice.  
→ Minimum notice obligations are triggered.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Advance notice and fair classification help maintain income stability and appropriate access to unemployment systems.

### 5.5 Tipped Wage Reform

**5.5.1 Wage Floor Requirement**  
Tipped workers must receive the full minimum wage **before tips**.

Tips:
- belong exclusively to the worker,
- may not be counted toward wage minimums.

**5.5.2 Back Pay Calculation**  
If wages fall below minimum:
- back pay shall equal the difference between minimum wage and base wage,
- calculated independently of tips received.

#### Summary — 5.5 Tipped Wage Reform
This subsection ensures tipped workers earn at least the full minimum wage before tips, that tips belong exclusively to the worker, and that any deficiency is made up through back pay independent of tips.

#### Examples
• A server’s hourly pay plus tips totals below minimum wage.  
→ Employer owes back pay equal to the difference.

• Tips are pooled and distributed in a way that displaces minimum wage protections.  
→ Tip ownership and back pay rules apply.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Tipped wage abuses perpetuate income instability and reduce affordability for essential workers who depend on fair base compensation.

### 5.6 Shift Timing & Worker Health

**5.6.1 Minimum Rest Periods**  
Employers must provide a minimum rest interval between shifts unless:
- adequate sleeping accommodations are provided,
- or emergency services justify extended shifts.

#### Summary — 5.6 Shift Timing & Worker Health
This subsection mandates minimum rest intervals between shifts, with exceptions for adequate sleeping accommodations or emergency service needs.

#### Examples
• A worker is scheduled back-to-back without sufficient rest.  
→ Rest period protections apply.

• A paramedic is scheduled 24-hour shifts without reasonable sleeping accommodations.  
→ Health provisions apply.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Insufficient rest and punitive shift design harm health, safety, productivity, and long-term affordability by increasing burnout and turnover.

### 5.7 Overtime Neutrality & Take-Home Protection

**5.7.1 Take-Home Neutrality Rule**  
Overtime compensation may not result in a lower net hourly rate than a worker’s base wage.

**5.7.2 Overtime Premium Protection**  
The overtime premium portion of pay (above base wage) shall be:
- taxed at a reduced marginal rate, or
- deferred for tax calculation purposes,
to preserve take-home fairness.

**5.7.3 Benefit Cliff Safeguard**  
Overtime earnings may not automatically trigger:
- loss of essential benefits,
- abrupt benefit phase-outs,
- or punitive contribution increases.

Benefit eligibility must consider sustained income, not temporary overtime spikes.

#### Summary — 5.7 Overtime Neutrality & Take-Home Protection
This subsection prevents overtime earnings from resulting in lower net hourly pay and protects workers from benefit loss due to temporary overtime spikes.

#### Examples
• Overtime pay, after standard tax rates, results in a lower effective hourly rate.  
→ Take-home neutrality safeguards apply.

• A brief increase in hours causes loss of essential benefits.  
→ Benefit cliff protections apply.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Workers should be incentivized — not penalized — for extra work, and benefit structures should not inadvertently discourage increased labor participation.
