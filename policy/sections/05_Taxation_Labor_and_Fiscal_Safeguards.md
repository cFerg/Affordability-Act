# Section 5 — Taxation, Labor, and Fiscal Safeguards

## Purpose
To ensure all citizens can meet basic living needs through fair wages, healthcare continuity, and equitable taxation.
This section eliminates the paradox where individuals can earn full-time wages yet still fall below the affordability threshold.

## Livable Minimum Wage (LMW)
- **Definition:** The minimum wage must equal or exceed the local **Livable Minimum Wage (LMW)**, defined as the income required to afford basic needs in that region.  
- **Formula:** LMW = (Regional Basic Cost Index ÷ 160), based on a 40-hour week.  
- **Basic Costs Include:**  
  - Food and nutrition standards  
  - Utilities, plumbing, and essential broadband  
  - Transportation (vehicle or public transit)  
  - Healthcare premiums or copays  
  - Average local rent or mortgage  
  - 10% emergency savings buffer  
- If a jurisdiction adopts a shorter workweek (e.g., 32 hours), the LMW is recalculated to maintain the same monthly income target.

## Wage Auditing and Enforcement
- The **Federal Office of Affordability Oversight (FOAO)** conducts biannual wage audits using regional income, cost-of-living, and inflation data.  
- Employers paying below LMW rates face restitution equal to back pay plus 20% penalty.  
- Tips and commissions cannot count toward minimum wage compliance.

## Health Coverage Continuity
- Public and private healthcare programs must guarantee **Continuous Eligibility**: no lapse may occur between policy end and new coverage start.  
- All enrollment systems must synchronize across Medicaid, Medicare, ACA, and employer coverage.  
- Enrollment must be open quarterly rather than annually.  
- A **Universal Minimum Coverage Standard** ensures that all residents have at least emergency and primary care access at no cost.

## Welfare Realignment and Transition
- SNAP, EBT, and other benefit programs convert to **Work-Integrated Assistance (WIA)** once wage reforms take effect.  
- Benefits taper gradually as income exceeds the LMW threshold, avoiding sudden drop-offs.  
- Recipients must either work, actively job-seek, or provide medical exemption proof.  
- Savings from reduced dependency fund local housing and job training programs.

## Taxation and Marital Equity
- Tax brackets apply **per individual**, not per household filing unit.  
- Dependents reduce taxable income equally for all filers, regardless of marital status.  
- Joint filing remains optional but cannot result in a higher tax burden than single filing.

## Fiscal Safeguards
- Any affordability-driven tax or wage reform cannot be offset by reducing public funding or raising unrelated taxes.  
- A **Fiscal Stability Board** monitors government revenue changes to ensure the reforms do not cause downstream inflation.
