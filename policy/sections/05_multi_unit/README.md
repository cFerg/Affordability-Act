## §5.1 Occupancy Floor & Ghost Inventory
Vacancy >20% without active renovation triggers a **vacancy surtax** (graduated) and a plan to lease/sell units at capped prices.

## §5.2 Rent Formation
For each unit: **Unit Share of AV** (by usable sq ft or rooms) + pro‑rata O&M budget = **Base Rent**; apply **RTB** *(Policy Dial: ±3%)*. Publish a **Rent Breakdown Sheet**.

## §5.3 Downward Adjustments
If current condition would yield a lower rent under RACV than under WIV, the tenant pays the **lesser** amount. Neglect cannot increase rent.

## §5.4 Conversion & Tenant Rights
Conversions require a tenant **right of first refusal**, relocation aid, and rent caps during transition.

## §5.5 Common Areas & Capital Plans
Reserve studies every 3 years; capital plans posted. Special assessments must tie to the plan or emergencies; installment options required.

## §5.6 Enforcement
- **Prohibited:** Rents above unit share of AV+O&M±RTB; neglect-based rent hikes; ghost-inventory (excess vacancy) to manipulate prices.
- **Remedies:** Tenant refunds; rent rollback; vacancy surtax; Tier II–III penalties; repeat → rent freeze under admin supervision.
- **Records:** Rent breakdown sheets (AV share, O&M, reserves), vacancy logs.
