# SECTION 6 — CREDIT, EMPLOYMENT & WORKER EQUITY

## 6.1 Credit Inquiry Reform
No hard pulls without explicit written consent for a specific transaction; unsuccessful applications auto-convert to soft pulls within 7 days; multiple pulls within 30 days count as one.

## 6.2 Alternative Qualification Standards
A non-credit pathway using verified income, employment stability (≥6 months), debt-to-income, and bill payment histories. Financial institutions shall maintain a Housing Affordability Verification Desk to compute a maximum sustainable housing allowance. Blanket 3×-rent rules are prohibited; cap is 2× unless documented risk warrants exception.

## 6.3 Employment Protections
Minimum 10 hours rest between shifts unless suitable sleep/rest facilities are provided for long shifts; all issued checks must be funded at issuance; all required pre/post-shift tasks are paid time.

## 6.4 Wage Baseline
Tipped employees receive full minimum wage **exclusive of tips**; service-charge tip skimming is banned; wage floors tie to regional cost of living where higher than federal.

## 6.5 Virtual Public Access
Public hearings, zoning meetings, and affordability boards must provide real-time virtual participation and accept digital written testimony.

## 6.6 Federal Minimum Baseline Reform
(a) Federal minimum = mean of state minimums (rounded to $0.05); may not decrease year-over-year.  
(b) Multi-state work: pay at the highest applicable minimum among states worked or the federal composite, whichever greater.  
(c) Classification based on where work is performed/managed, not hire location.  
(d) States may not lower minimums below prior year to affect the composite.  
(e) Department of Labor publishes the composite by Jan 31 annually.

## 6.7 Alternative Credit Data Inclusion
Credit bureaus must accept and score verified rent and utility histories by default; consumers can dispute omissions without charge.
