# Section 6 — Enforcement, Compliance, and Appeals

## Purpose
To define enforcement mechanisms and ensure consistent compliance across all sectors affected by the Affordability Act.

## Federal Office of Affordability Oversight (FOAO)
- The FOAO is a federally chartered agency responsible for:  
  - Auditing affordability metrics, valuations, and wage compliance.  
  - Managing the Certified Offer Registry (COR).  
  - Conducting investigations and coordinating state-level enforcement.
- The FOAO must publish an annual **Affordability Report** detailing national progress, identified violations, and recommendations for amendment.

## Penalties
- Civil penalties include fines up to 200% of the profit gained from violations.  
- Repeat or deliberate offenses may escalate to criminal penalties including imprisonment or forfeiture of assets.  
- Violators found guilty of manipulating valuations, suppressing listings, or wage evasion may be barred from property ownership or corporate leadership for up to 10 years.

## Appeals Process
- Any individual or entity has the right to appeal enforcement actions within 60 days of notice.  
- Appeals may be filed digitally or by mail through FOAO regional offices.  
- An independent arbitration panel reviews all appeals, with final recourse through the federal judiciary.

## Enforcement of Ownership and Maintenance
- FOAO and local governments have authority to enforce blight laws, ownership stewardship, and affordability compliance.  
- Neglected or vacant properties under stewardship must be maintained until resold or reassigned.  
- Owners must comply with upkeep standards or risk custodial transfer.

## Transparency and Whistleblower Protection
- All FOAO investigations, outcomes, and appeals must be logged publicly except when privacy law prevents disclosure.  
- Whistleblowers who report violations are legally protected against retaliation and entitled to up to 10% of recovered restitution.
