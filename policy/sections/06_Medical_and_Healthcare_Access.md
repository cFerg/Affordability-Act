## Legal-Style Provisions

### 6.1 Emergency vs Non-Emergency Care Separation

**6.1.1 Emergency Care Coverage**  
Emergency medical treatment required to preserve life or prevent serious harm shall:
- be provided without regard to insurance status,
- not require prior authorization.

**6.1.2 Public Responsibility for Emergency Transport**  
Emergency medical transportation shall be covered through:
- public emergency services,
- or public insurance mechanisms,
and may not result in excessive out-of-pocket charges.

#### Summary — 6.1
This subsection ensures that life-preserving emergency medical care and emergency transport are provided based on medical need, not ability to pay, and distinguishes them from non-emergency services to prevent system abuse.

#### Examples
• A patient is urgently transported for a heart attack.  
→ Emergency care and transport are provided with financial protections.

• A non-life-threatening condition is repeatedly treated through emergency services.  
→ Appropriate referral to non-emergency care channels follows review.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Separating emergency from non-emergency care protects critical access while maintaining system sustainability and preventing denial of necessary treatment due to cost barriers.

### 6.2 Continuous Healthcare Enrollment

**6.2.1 Year-Round Enrollment Requirement**  
Public healthcare programs, including Medicaid, must allow:
- continuous enrollment year-round,
- enrollment upon change in income, employment, or eligibility.

**6.2.2 Enrollment Timing Protection**  
Individuals denied public coverage after an employer enrollment window closes must be:
- granted a special enrollment period,
- or automatically provisionally covered.

#### Summary — 6.2
This subsection ensures public healthcare programs, including Medicaid, allow continuous year-round enrollment and protect individuals from coverage gaps due to administrative timing issues.

#### Examples
• An individual loses job-based insurance and is denied Medicaid because enrollment closed.  
→ Enrollment timing protections apply.

• A worker experiences income change impacting eligibility.  
→ Year-round enrollment and provisional coverage apply.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Healthcare access should not depend on bureaucratic windows or job-based timing; continuous coverage prevents financial and health insecurity.

### 6.3 Essential Medical Items & Price Controls

**6.3.1 Covered Medical Necessities**  
The following essential medical items shall be provided at regulated or no cost:
- insulin,
- epinephrine auto-injectors,
- inhalers,
- menstrual hygiene products,
- and other life-sustaining necessities.

**6.3.2 Anti-Gouging Rule**  
Manufacturers and distributors may not inflate prices of essential medical items beyond regulated cost-plus thresholds.

#### Summary — 6.3
This subsection defines essential, life-sustaining medical items that must be provided at regulated cost or no cost and prohibits gouging by manufacturers and distributors.

#### Examples
• Insulin retail prices spike far above documented production cost.  
→ Price-controlled access and anti-gouging protections apply.

• A patient requires an epinephrine auto-injector for survival.  
→ Must be available at regulated pricing.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Essential medications and life-preserving items should be accessible to all, not priced beyond reach due to market manipulation.

### 6.4 Insurance Fairness & Stability

**6.4.1 Coverage Stability**  
Insurance providers may not:
- cancel coverage mid-term except for fraud,
- raise premiums absent documented risk change.

**6.4.2 Non-Event Premium Increases Prohibited**  
Premium increases justified solely by:
- general inflation,
- unrelated market losses,
are prohibited.

#### Summary — 6.4
This subsection stabilizes insurance coverage by preventing mid-term cancellation (absent fraud) and barring premium increases based solely on general inflation or unrelated market losses.

#### Examples
• Coverage is cancelled mid-term without documented fraud.  
→ Cancellation is prohibited.

• Premiums rise for all policyholders based on industry losses unrelated to individual risk.  
→ Non-event premium increases are disallowed.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Insurance should respond to individual risk and documented factors, not act as a hidden inflationary mechanism that raises essential cost burdens.

---

### 6.5 Abuse Prevention & Accountability

**6.5.1 Care Abuse Review**  
Patterns of non-emergency misuse of emergency services may be reviewed, but:
- care may not be denied retroactively,
- emergency determination defaults in favor of patient safety.

**6.5.2 Health Outcome Focus**  
Preventative care and treatment programs must prioritize long-term health outcomes over punitive denial of services.

#### Summary — 6.5
This subsection permits review of patterns of non-emergency misuse of emergency services without denying care, and directs preventative programs to focus on health outcomes over punitive exclusion.

#### Examples
• A patient routinely uses ER for non-urgent care.  
→ Review occurs, but care is not retroactively denied.

• Prevention programs are structured around outcomes rather than penalties.  
→ Health outcome focus is enforced.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Balancing abuse prevention with care access protects public resources while safeguarding individual needs and preventing punitive barriers.

### 6.6 Veterinary Care Pricing & Emergency Standards

**6.6.1 Emergency Severity Classification**
Veterinary services shall be classified as:
- emergency (imminent risk of death or severe suffering),
- urgent,
- non-emergency or elective.

Emergency cases must prioritize stabilization before billing discussions.

**6.6.2 Emergency Pricing Protections**
In emergency situations:
- payment may not be demanded prior to stabilization,
- cost ranges must be disclosed post-stabilization,
- coercive “pay-now-or-else” pricing is prohibited.

**6.6.3 Transparency & Documentation**
Veterinary providers must document:
- emergency classification rationale,
- services rendered prior to billing,
- itemized charges.

#### Summary — 6.6
This subsection applies affordability and ethical standards to veterinary care, especially emergency services, ensuring stabilization before billing and transparent documentation.

#### Examples
• A pet experiences life-threatening injury requiring immediate care.  
→ Emergency stabilization is provided before billing.

• Veterinary provider fails to itemize emergency charges.  
→ Transparency and documentation requirements apply.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Veterinary emergencies are time-sensitive and often unavoidable; ethical pricing protects owners and prevents public shelter burden from abandoned animals.

### 6.7 Spay, Neuter & Responsible Breeding

**6.7.4 Mandatory Spay & Neuter**
Routine spay or neuter is required for non-licensed animals, except where medically contraindicated.

**6.7.5 Licensed Breeding Requirements**
Breeding is restricted to licensed individuals or entities, requiring:
- veterinary health certification,
- genetic diversity safeguards,
- welfare standards.

#### Summary — 6.7
This subsection mandates spay/neuter procedures for non-licensed animals and regulates breeding to licensed individuals with health and welfare standards.

#### Examples
• A pet owner refuses spay/neuter without medical contraindication.  
→ Spay/neuter requirement applies.

• Unregulated breeding results in health or genetic issues.  
→ Licensed breeding standards are enforced.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Responsible population control reduces shelter overcrowding, inbreeding, and public costs associated with abandoned or unhealthy animals.

### 6.8 Essential Medication Price Protections

**6.8.6 Definition of Essential Medications**
Essential medications include, but are not limited to:
- insulin,
- inhalers,
- epinephrine,
- critical cardiac and seizure medications.

**6.8.7 Cost-Based Pricing Requirement**
Prices must remain within a reasonable multiple of:
- verified production cost,
- distribution and compliance costs,
- reasonable profit margins.

**6.8.8 Prohibited Practices**
It is unlawful to:
- exploit patent monopolies to inflate prices,
- suppress competition through exclusivity abuse,
- acquire and shelve alternatives to maintain scarcity.

#### Enforcement & Remedies  
Violations constitute price gouging and may trigger:
- forced price correction,
- restitution,
- loss of exclusivity protections.

#### Summary — 6.8
This subsection defines essential medications and enforces cost-based pricing, banning monopolistic exploitation, exclusivity abuse, and scarcity schemes that raise prices beyond reasonable thresholds.

#### Examples
• A pharmaceutical company uses patent exclusivity to suppress competition and inflate price.  
→ Prohibited practices trigger price correction.

• Prices remain far above documented production and distribution costs.  
→ Cost-based pricing enforcement applies.

#### Why this subsection exists  
Health should never be contingent on exorbitant drug prices; essential medications must be priced for access, not extraction.
