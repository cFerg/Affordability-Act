## Section 6 — Healthcare Access, Coverage & Medical Necessities

## Plain-English Summary  
Access to healthcare should not depend on employment timing, administrative windows, or emergency circumstances beyond a person’s control. This section separates emergency from non-emergency care, ensures continuous coverage access, and guarantees affordability of essential medical items without price exploitation.
