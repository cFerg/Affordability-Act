# Section 7 — Integrity, Accountability, and Global Fairness

## Purpose
To preserve the integrity of national and international markets while ensuring affordability protections are applied equally and fairly across all jurisdictions.

## Bankruptcy Transparency
- Entities filing bankruptcy must disclose all domestic and foreign assets.  
- Transfer of ownership to family or shell corporations within 36 months before filing is automatically subject to review and potential clawback.  
- Executives or board members found abusing bankruptcy protections lose eligibility for corporate registration for 10 years.

## Offshore Accounts and Tax Evasion
- Any individual or corporation with U.S. assets must declare all offshore holdings annually.  
- Undeclared assets are subject to immediate forfeiture under the **Foreign Affordability Transparency Act (FATA)**.  
- Financial institutions failing to report holdings face joint liability.

## Market Stabilization: Affordability Equity Adjustment Mechanism (AEAM)
- When affordability reforms reduce corporate nominal asset valuations, affected companies may issue **share adjustments** (non-monetary compensation).  
- Example: if valuation drops by 50%, the company may issue a 2-for-1 split, maintaining total shareholder value.  
- AEAM transactions must be disclosed to the SEC and shareholders before execution.  
- This ensures affordability progress without destabilizing retirement funds or public investment portfolios.

## International Reciprocity
- Any foreign entity operating within U.S. property, vehicle, or insurance markets must comply with affordability and transparency standards.  
- Reciprocal enforcement agreements shall be pursued with partner nations.

## Penalty Structure
1. **Tier 1 – Omission or Negligence:** Civil fine up to 200% of hidden value.  
2. **Tier 2 – Willful Concealment:** Criminal charges and up to 10 years imprisonment.  
3. **Tier 3 – Systemic Abuse or Repeat Offense:** Asset forfeiture and permanent disqualification from market participation.

## Global Cooperation
- The FOAO, Treasury, and State Department will coordinate global data sharing on property, asset ownership, and affordability indices.  
- A biannual **Global Affordability Report** will measure international compliance and recommend global alignment standards.
