# 💡 Utilities & Internet  
## Section 7 — Utilities, Infrastructure & Broadband Access

## Plain-English Summary  
Essential utilities are required for modern life and work. Pricing volatility, artificial scarcity, and outdated infrastructure impose unnecessary financial strain. This section ensures fair utility pricing, stable access, and modern broadband availability as a baseline service for all residents.

---

## Legal-Style Provisions

### 7.1 Essential Utility Classification

**7.1.1 Covered Utilities**  
The following services are classified as essential utilities:
- electricity,
- water and sewage,
- heating and cooling,
- basic residential internet access.

**7.1.2 Continuous Service Requirement**  
Essential utilities may not be disconnected due to:
- billing disputes under review,
- temporary hardship,
- extreme weather conditions.

---

### 7.2 Utility Pricing Stability & Transparency

**7.2.1 Anti-Volatility Rule**  
Utility providers may not impose sudden rate increases due solely to:
- seasonal demand,
- market speculation,
- generalized inflation claims.

**7.2.2 Cost Justification Requirement**  
Rate increases must be supported by:
- documented operating cost changes,
- public disclosure and review.

---

### 7.3 Infrastructure & Modernization Standards

**7.3.1 Fiber-First Requirement**  
New residential developments receiving public permits or funds must:
- install fiber-optic infrastructure where feasible,
- avoid obsolete copper-based bottlenecks.

**7.3.2 Universal Baseline Access**  
Every residence must have access to:
- sufficient internet speeds for education, work, and communication,
- without mandatory premium pricing.

---

### 7.4 Billing Fairness & Consumer Protections

**7.4.1 Usage Transparency**  
Consumers must be provided:
- clear usage metrics,
- understandable billing statements.

**7.4.2 No Punitive Minimums**  
Minimum usage fees or penalties unrelated to actual consumption are prohibited.

---

### 7.5 Infrastructure Extension Cost Controls

#### Plain-English Summary  
Internet access is foundational to education, employment, and civic participation. Infrastructure extension fees must reflect real cost, not monopoly leverage.

---

**7.5.1 Cost-Based Installation Limits**
Charges for extending infrastructure must be based on:
- actual material cost,
- documented labor,
- reasonable profit margins.

---

**7.5.2 Prohibition on Extortionate Pricing**
Per-foot pricing disconnected from material cost is prohibited.

Infrastructure access may not be denied through artificially inflated fees.

---

#### Illustrative Example  
A provider charges $11,000 to extend a line 350 feet where materials cost pennies per foot.  
→ Prohibited pricing abuse.

---

#### Why This Exists  
Digital exclusion drives inequality.  
Access should be expanded, not ransomed.

---

## Example Scenarios (Illustrative)

**Example 1: Winter Rate Spike**  
An electric utility raises rates sharply during winter without cost justification.  
→ This violates pricing stability requirements.

**Example 2: New Housing Development**  
A new subdivision installs copper internet lines despite fiber availability.  
→ This fails modernization standards.

**Example 3: Billing Dispute Shutoff**  
A household disputes a bill and service is disconnected mid-review.  
→ Disconnection is prohibited.
