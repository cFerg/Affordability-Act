# 💡 Utilities & Internet  
## Section 7 — Utilities, Infrastructure & Broadband Access

## Section 7 Purpose
This section ensures infrastructure and utility services (electricity, water, broadband) are reliable, fairly priced, nondiscriminatory, and accessible.
It prioritizes essential access, prevents exploitative rate spikes, and promotes community resiliency through transparent pricing and accountability.

## Legal-Style Provisions

### 7.1 Essential Utility Classification

**7.1.1 Covered Utilities**  
The following services are classified as essential utilities:
- electricity,
- water and sewage,
- heating and cooling,
- basic residential internet access.

**7.1.2 Continuous Service Requirement**  
Essential utilities may not be disconnected due to:
- billing disputes under review,
- temporary hardship,
- extreme weather conditions.

#### Summary — 7.1 Essential Utility Classification
This subsection defines which services are treated as essential utilities and establishes baseline continuity protections to prevent loss of life, displacement, or coercion through shutoffs.

#### Examples
• A household faces water shutoff during a billing dispute that is actively under review.  
→ Disconnection is prohibited while the dispute is pending.

• An electric utility disconnects power during a severe cold snap for late payment.  
→ Extreme weather protections apply.

#### Why this subsection exists
Utilities like electricity and water are not optional in modern life. Treating them as “discretionary” enables coercive shutoffs that worsen poverty and public health risks.

### 7.2 Utility Pricing Stability & Transparency

**7.2.1 Anti-Volatility Rule**  
Utility providers may not impose sudden rate increases due solely to:
- seasonal demand,
- market speculation,
- generalized inflation claims.

**7.2.2 Cost Justification Requirement**  
Rate increases must be supported by:
- documented operating cost changes,
- public disclosure and review.

#### Summary — 7.2 Utility Pricing Stability & Transparency
This subsection prevents unjustified rate spikes and requires utility providers to justify increases with documented cost drivers and public disclosure.

#### Examples
• Winter rates jump sharply with no supporting operating-cost disclosure.  
→ Violates the anti-volatility rule.

• A provider claims “inflation” as the reason for a major increase but produces no cost breakdown.  
→ Increase is disallowed until justified.

#### Why this subsection exists
Unpredictable utility pricing functions like an unavoidable inflation tax. Households can’t budget when essentials can spike without accountability.

### 7.3 Infrastructure & Modernization Standards

**7.3.1 Fiber-First Requirement**  
New residential developments receiving public permits or funds must:
- install fiber-optic infrastructure where feasible,
- avoid obsolete copper-based bottlenecks.

**7.3.2 Universal Baseline Access**  
Every residence must have access to:
- sufficient internet speeds for education, work, and communication,
- without mandatory premium pricing.

#### Summary — 7.3 Infrastructure & Modernization Standards
This subsection ensures new builds and publicly permitted developments are future-proofed (fiber-first where feasible) and that every residence has baseline broadband sufficient for work, school, and communication.

#### Examples
• A new subdivision installs copper lines even though fiber deployment is feasible.  
→ Fails modernization standards.

• A resident can only access usable internet by paying “premium tiers.”  
→ Baseline access must be available without mandatory premium pricing.

#### Why this subsection exists
Outdated infrastructure creates long-term bottlenecks and forces residents to pay more later. Broadband access is now a core requirement for economic participation.

### 7.4 Billing Fairness & Consumer Protections

**7.4.1 Usage Transparency**  
Consumers must be provided:
- clear usage metrics,
- understandable billing statements.

**7.4.2 No Punitive Minimums**  
Minimum usage fees or penalties unrelated to actual consumption are prohibited.

#### Summary — 7.4 Billing Fairness & Consumer Protections
This subsection requires clear, understandable billing and prohibits punitive billing structures unrelated to actual usage, including hidden minimums that inflate costs.

#### Examples
• A bill is unreadable and lacks clear usage metrics that explain the charges.  
→ Violates usage transparency requirements.

• A utility charges a “minimum usage fee” that applies even when consumption is low or zero.  
→ Prohibited unless tied to documented service delivery costs under transparent rules.

#### Why this subsection exists
Billing opacity and artificial minimums allow utilities to extract more money without delivering more service, raising baseline living costs invisibly.

### 7.5 Infrastructure Extension Cost Controls

**7.5.1 Cost-Based Installation Limits**
Charges for extending infrastructure must be based on:
- actual material cost,
- documented labor,
- reasonable profit margins.

**7.5.2 Prohibition on Extortionate Pricing**
Per-foot pricing disconnected from material cost is prohibited.

Infrastructure access may not be denied through artificially inflated fees.

#### Summary — 7.5 Infrastructure Extension Cost Controls
Internet access is foundational to education, employment, and civic participation. Infrastructure extension fees must reflect real cost, not monopoly leverage.

#### Example  
A provider charges $11,000 to extend a line 350 feet where materials cost pennies per foot.  
→ Prohibited pricing abuse.

#### Why this subsection exists 
Digital exclusion drives inequality.  
Access should be expanded, not ransomed.
