# Payment Integrity (All Housing/Lodging Contracts)
<!-- SUMMARY
Requires at least one low-fee, traceable electronic payment option and itemized receipts; bans “cash-only/money-order-only” mandates except during verified outages. Prohibits junk add-on fees that function as price-cap evasion; mandates clean ledgers for deposits, rent-to-own, STRs, and hotels.
