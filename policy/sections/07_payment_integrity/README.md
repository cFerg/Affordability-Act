# Payment Integrity (All Housing/Lodging Contracts)

## §7.1 Covered Arrangements
Leases, rent‑to‑own/contract‑for‑deed, mortgages/servicing, HOA/condo/co‑op fees, campgrounds/RV, hotels/motels, STR platforms (Airbnb/VRBO).

## §7.2 No Cash‑Only; No‑Fee Digital Path
Providers must offer **no‑fee ACH/e‑check/bank bill‑pay**. Cards optional with surcharge ≤ processor cost and ≤ 2% *(Policy Dial)*. Off‑platform cash for STRs prohibited.

## §7.3 Receipts & Posting
Immediate e‑receipt; post payments same/next business day. Missed posting → **late fees waived + $10 posting credit** *(Policy Dial)*.

## §7.4 Grace/NSF/Disputes
≥5 business‑day grace; NSF = pass‑through + $10; good‑faith disputes pause late fees. Anti‑retaliation for choosing no‑fee method.

## §7.5 Privacy/Security
PCI DSS (cards) and NACHA (ACH) compliance; data used only for posting/reconciliation.

## §7.6 Enforcement
Non‑compliant demand = unenforceable “non‑payment” for that cycle; restitution + civil penalties; private right of action with fee‑shifting.

## §7.7 Pay Statement Breakout (Service Establishments)
Employers in covered service industries must provide itemized statements showing **base wages**, **tips received**, and **service charges distributed** for each pay period. Cross-reference §19.3–§19.5. Failure to provide a compliant breakdown is a recordkeeping violation under §19.5(g).
