# Motor Vehicles — Pricing Reversion & Dealer Practices
<!-- SUMMARY
Caps used-vehicle prices by a Normalized Market Value (NMV) from MSRP, age, mileage, and condition tiers; antiques/rarities have higher but defined caps. Bans junk fees, pegs doc fees to local wage hours, and requires itemized add-ons/trade-ins so caps can’t be bypassed.
