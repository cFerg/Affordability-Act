# 🛒 Consumer Responsibility & Fraud  
## Section 9 — Consumer Responsibility, Waste Prevention & Anti-Fraud Protections

## Plain-English Summary  
Affordability depends not only on fair pricing, but on responsible participation. Deliberate waste, fraud, and abuse increase costs for everyone. This section restores accountability for intentional damage, food waste, payment abuse, and exploitative behavior that distorts prices and undermines public trust.

### 9.2 Food Waste & Spoilage Prevention

**9.2.1 Spoilage as a Distinct Harm**  
Deliberately placing perishable food in conditions that cause spoilage constitutes a violation separate from theft.

### 9.3 Payment Integrity & Fraud Prevention

**9.3.1 Payment Method Transparency**

- cash,
- check,
or other methods that eliminate verifiable transaction records.

At least one traceable electronic payment option must be offered.

**9.3.2 Anti-Evasion Rule**  
Practices intended to:
- evade taxes,
- obscure payment history,
- or deny proof of payment,
constitute fraud.

### 9.4 Abuse of Assistance & Public Resources

## Example Scenarios (Illustrative)

**Example 1: Deliberate Store Damage**  
An individual intentionally destroys merchandise assuming insurance will cover it.  
→ The individual may be charged for damages.

**Example 2: Food Spoilage Abuse**  
Frozen food is deliberately left on unrefrigerated shelves to spoil.  
→ This may be penalized more severely than theft.

**Example 3: Cash-Only Rent Scheme**  
A landlord requires cash-only rent to avoid records.  
→ This violates payment integrity rules.
