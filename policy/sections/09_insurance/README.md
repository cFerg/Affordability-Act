# Insurance — Premium Fairness (Auto/Home/Renters)

## §9.1 Align Coverage with Lawful Value
Homes: Coverage A based on **min(WIV, RACV)** + code‑upgrade cushion *(Policy Dial: 10–15%)* unless waived. Vehicles: physical damage on **VWIV minus depreciation/repairs**. After reset, carriers must re‑rate in 30 days and refund mid‑term overcharges.

## §9.2 No‑Claim/No‑Change Cap
If no at‑fault claims and insured value didn’t rise, total premium change ≤ **min(wage index, pure loss‑cost index)**. CPI alone insufficient.

## §9.3 Surcharges & Sunsets
Minor at‑fault surcharge capped *(Policy Dial: 10–15%)* and sunsets after 36 months claim‑free; schedule published on declarations.

## §9.4 Catastrophe & Reinsurance Transparency
Separate line item; **12‑month sunset**; clawback credits if realized loss ratios beat the filing by ≥5–10 pts.

## §9.5 Factors & Fairness
Ban price optimization; limit non‑risk factors (credit, education, occupation, micro‑territory) to minimal weight with disclosure. Prior approval with public summaries.

## §9.6 Telematics & Portability
Opt‑in only; minimal retention; data portable to new carrier upon request.

## §9.7 Mortgage/Escrow Pass‑Through
Servicers must re‑run escrow and lower payments within 60 days of premium decreases.

## §9.8 Enforcement
- **Prohibited:** Premiums based on unlawful values; hidden catastrophe surcharges; failure to roll back after value drops.
- **Remedies:** Premium refunds + interest; clawback of CAT surcharges after sunset; Tier II–III penalties; filing disapproval.
- **Records:** Rate basis statement; CAT surcharge ledger; escrow recalculation logs.
