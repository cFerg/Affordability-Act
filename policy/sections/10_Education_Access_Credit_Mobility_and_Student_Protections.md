# 🎓 Education Access, Credit Mobility & Student Protections  
## Section 10 — Education Access, Credit Mobility & Student Protections

## Plain-English Summary  
Education affordability is not just tuition — it includes housing, food, credit recognition, and system fairness. This section removes artificial barriers that trap students financially, ensures credits follow the student, and prevents administrative failures from destroying educational paths.

---

## Legal-Style Provisions

### 10.1 Degree Structure & Credit Relevance

**10.1.1 Degree-Focused Curriculum**  
Institutions may not require excessive coursework unrelated to a student’s degree path solely to extend enrollment.

---

### 10.2 Transfer Credit Fairness

**10.2.1 Credit Recognition**  
Credits earned at accredited institutions must transfer with equivalent weight.

**10.2.2 Prohibited Credit Caps**  
Arbitrary limits on transferable credits are prohibited.

---

### 10.2A Credit Persistence & Major Mobility

**10.2A.1 Credit Persistence Rule**  
Credits earned remain valid regardless of:
- major changes,
- school transfers,
- degree pathway adjustments.

Credits may be reapplied to new programs where relevant.

**10.2A.2 Major Change Protection**  
Institutions may not restrict students from changing majors through:
- mandatory waiting periods,
- credit forfeiture,
- artificial probation triggers.

---

#### Example (Illustrative)

A student transfers from IST to Engineering, then back to IST.  
Credits earned may not be invalidated or locked to a single pathway.

---

### 10.3 Academic Probation & Due Process

**10.3.1 Procedural Safeguards**  
Students may not be penalized due to:
- system errors,
- delayed grade processing,
- administrative faults.

**10.3.2 Appeal & Correction Window**  
Institutions must provide correction mechanisms before probation or dismissal.

---

### 10.4 Financial Aid & Housing Protections

**10.4.1 Aid Continuity**  
Housing and financial aid may not be withdrawn due to:
- unresolved administrative disputes,
- short-term enrollment anomalies.

**10.4.2 Housing Equity**  
Upperclassmen and nontraditional students must have access to housing support equivalent to underclassmen.

---
### 10.5 Student Loan Equity

**10.5.1 Federal vs Private Loan Neutrality**  
Relief programs must not discriminate based on loan origin.

**10.5.2 Living-Cost Transparency**  
Institutions must disclose when student loans primarily subsidize housing and food rather than education.

---
### 10.6 Student Loan Minimum Payment Integrity

A “minimum payment” that causes a loan balance to grow is not a payment — it is a penalty. Student loans must follow the same amortization principles as other consumer loans, where meeting the minimum obligation results in actual progress toward payoff.

---

**10.6.1 Definition of Minimum Payment** 
For student loans, the minimum payment is defined as the amount required to:
- cover accrued interest, and
- reduce principal by a non-zero amount.

Any payment structure that fails to meet this standard is non-compliant.

---

**10.6.2 Prohibition on Negative Amortization** 
Negative amortization — where loan balances increase despite timely minimum payments — is prohibited.

Interest may accrue beyond minimum payments only when:
- the borrower pays less than the required minimum, or
- the borrower has explicitly requested deferment or forbearance.

---

**10.6.3 Transparency & Disclosure**
Lenders must clearly disclose:
- how minimum payments are calculated,
- how much principal will be reduced per payment,
- the projected payoff timeline at the minimum rate.

Failure to disclose constitutes deceptive lending.

---

**10.6.4 Enforcement & Remedies**
Loans found to violate minimum payment integrity must:
- have excess interest reversed,
- be re-amortized to compliant terms,
- and refund overpayments where applicable.

---

#### Illustrative Example  
A borrower pays the stated minimum for five years and owes more than the original balance.  
→ This loan structure is unlawful under this Act.

---

#### Why This Exists  
Education debt should reward responsibility, not punish it.  
When minimum payments fail to reduce debt, borrowers are trapped indefinitely — undermining education, work, and family stability.

---

### 10.7 Food Access & Campus Support

**10.7.1 Enrollment-Based Food Access**  
Enrolled students must have access to affordable or free campus food services.

---

## Section-Wide Examples (Illustrative)

**Example 1: Credit Trap**  
A student is forced to retake passed courses after changing majors.  
→ Prohibited under credit persistence rules.

**Example 2: Administrative Failure**  
System errors place a student on probation, triggering housing loss.  
→ Institution must restore standing and aid.

---

## Why This Section Exists

Education should expand opportunity — not become a financial snare.

This section ensures **learning progress is preserved, mobility is protected, and students are not punished for system failures**.
