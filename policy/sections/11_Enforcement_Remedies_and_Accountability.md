<!--
SUMMARY:
Establishes uniform enforcement so affordability protections are real, not optional.
Applies the Act equally to individuals, corporations, trusts, institutions, and foreign owners.
Defines penalties, restitution, corrective orders, and anti-avoidance clawbacks.
Prevents contract waivers, shell transfers, and strategic bankruptcy from defeating accountability.

# ⚖️ Enforcement & Accountability  
## Section 11 — Enforcement, Remedies & Accountability

## Plain-English Summary  
Affordability protections are meaningless without enforcement. This section establishes uniform enforcement standards, meaningful remedies, and clear accountability to ensure that no individual, corporation, or institution can evade the protections of this Act through loopholes, delay, or power imbalance.

## Example Scenarios (Illustrative)

**Example 1: Corporate Evasion**  
A company transfers properties between subsidiaries to avoid price caps.  
→ Transfers are voided and enforcement proceeds against beneficial owners.

**Example 2: Strategic Bankruptcy**  
An investor files bankruptcy while retaining asset control through relatives.  
→ Court may disregard the structure and enforce penalties.

**Example 3: Contractual Waiver Attempt**  
A lease attempts to waive tenant rights under this Act.  
→ The waiver is unenforceable.

## Why This Section Exists

Without enforcement:
- affordability protections collapse,
- power imbalances persist,
- and violations become profitable.

This section ensures **the Act is real, enforceable, and durable**.
