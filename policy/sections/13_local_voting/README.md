# Local Voting Integrity (Model Policy)

## §13.1 Single‑Domicile Voting
Vote only where you **live** (domicile). Owning extra property elsewhere does not confer voting rights there.

## §13.2 Residency Minimum
Must reside in the jurisdiction at least **30–60 days** before election *(Policy Dial)*, consistent with state law.

## §13.3 Ban Non‑Resident Property Ballots
Municipalities/special districts may not create property‑owner electorates for land‑use/housing/tax matters, except narrow state‑mandated cases.

## §13.4 Beneficial‑Owner Consolidation
LLC/trust ownership does not create extra electors; consolidate to natural persons and domicile rule applies.

## §13.5 Enforcement
- **Prohibited:** Multiple-domicile voting; beneficial-owner vote stacking; offering consideration to influence ballots.
- **Remedies:** Ballot invalidation; Tier II–III penalties; referral to elections authority; disqualification in affected proceedings.
- **Records:** Domicile verification; beneficial-owner attestations.
