# Property Taxes — Assessment & Levy Alignment

## §14.1 Assessed Value
Homesteads and rentals assessed at **min(WIV, RACV)** with mandatory repair deductions. Assessors may not exceed either input.

## §14.2 Revenue‑Neutral Rollback (Truth‑in‑Taxation+)
When total assessed value rises, millage rolls back so levy growth ≤ **wage index** unless voters approve more. If values fall, millage may adjust to hold services steady but levy growth still ≤ wage index without a vote.

## §14.3 Circuit‑Breaker Relief
Refund/credit taxes above **X% of household income** *(Policy Dial: 5–7%)*. Automatic with annual income verification; renters treated via a deemed‑tax share of rent *(Policy Dial: 15–20%)*.

## §14.4 Homestead Protections
Annual cap at wage index; portability within state; senior/disabled deferral with simple interest capped at prime + 2%.

## §14.5 Appeals & VRB
Repair‑adjusted reinspection on request; VRB decision within 45 days; corrections retroactive with interest.

## §14.6 Vehicles (if ad valorem)
Use **AVV** (min(VWIV − depreciation − repairs, RACVV)); registration fees indexed to local wage, not CPI.
