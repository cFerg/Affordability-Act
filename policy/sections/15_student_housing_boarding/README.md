# Student Housing & Boarding Prices

## §15.1 Scope
Covers on-campus and university-affiliated housing, master-leased blocks, and third-party (P3) student housing marketed primarily to enrolled students, plus mandatory or bundled **meal plans**.

## §15.2 Price Formation (Boarding Price Cap)
For each term, set a **Boarding Price Cap (BPC)** per bed =  
**Cost of Provision per Bed** (O&M + staffing + utilities + campus services)  
+ **Capital Reserve** (for major repairs; policy dial: 6–10% of O&M)  
+ **Wage Guard** (≤ local wage index change year-over-year)  
+ **Modest Margin** (policy dial: ≤ 5%).  
Publish a **Boarding Statement** with these line items.

> BPC is a *ceiling*; scholarships/grants may lower student charges below BPC.

## §15.3 Ring-Fencing & No Cross-Subsidy
Housing/boarding revenue and designated housing funds are **ring-fenced**: no transfers to athletics, endowment, or unrelated operations. Surpluses must either (i) reduce next term’s BPC or (ii) fund capital reserves.

## §15.4 Meal Plans & Bundling
- No **mandatory** meal plan bundling unless the facility lacks in-unit kitchens *and* a basic plan is offered at cost.  
- Meal plan pricing must show food cost, labor, overhead, and margin (≤ 5%). Unused balances refundable at term’s end minus actual card processing costs.

## §15.5 First-Look & Priority
Priority ladder: (1) houseless/financial-need students, (2) first-year, (3) international, (4) remainder; lottery within rung if oversubscribed.

## §15.6 Third-Party Providers (P3)
Affiliates and P3s must: (a) adopt BPC, (b) publish Boarding Statements, (c) accept audit, (d) honor §7 Payment Integrity (no cash-only). Violations → refunds + penalties; repeat → loss of affiliation.

## §15.7 Transparency & Audits
Post audited Boarding Statements each term. Random audits ≥10% annually (policy dial). Overcharges → refund + 2× penalty; future BPC reduced by the overcharge rate.

## §15.8 Habitability & Repairs
Apply RACV logic: unsafe or substandard units trigger **mandatory credits** until cured; neglect cannot justify higher pricing.

## §15.9 Enforcement
- **Prohibited:** Boarding above BPC; meal-plan markups beyond cap; ring-fence breaches; forced bundles without kitchens/basic plan.
- **Remedies:** Refunds; next-term BPC reduction by overcharge rate; Tier II–III penalties; loss of affiliation for P3 repeaters.
- **Records:** Boarding Statements; audited cost lines; plan usage/refund logs.
