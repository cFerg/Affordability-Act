# Development Grants, Subsidies & Incentives

## §16.1 Pass-Through to End Buyers/Renters
Any public grant, tax credit, land discount, fee waiver, or infrastructure contribution **reduces** the **Wage-Indexed Value (WIV)** dollar-for-dollar for affected units so the benefit lowers the **Applicable Value (AV)** and capped rent/sale price.

## §16.2 No Double Counting
Developers may not add subsidized costs to WIV. Public dollars offset private cost basis first.

## §16.3 Conditions, Reporting, Clawbacks
Publish subsidy term sheets and unit-level benefit pass-throughs. Non-compliance → (i) price/rent rollback, (ii) restitution, (iii) clawback of incentives, and (iv) ineligibility for 3 years.

## §16.4 Affordability Period
Subsidized units carry an affordability period (policy dial: 20–30 years) during which AV caps and income targeting apply.

## §16.5 Grant-to-Value Converter
In pro formas, treat grants as **negative basis**; financing models must show a consumer price effect commensurate with the subsidy.

## §16.6 Interaction with §3 Rezoning Dividend
Public incentives may satisfy part of the rezoning dividend if they are applied to on-site affordability at or below AV; documentation required.

## §16.7 Enforcement
- **Prohibited:** Double-counting subsidies in WIV; failure to pass through benefits.
- **Remedies:** Price/rent rollback; restitution; clawback of incentives; 3-year ineligibility for programs; Tier III penalty.
- **Records:** Unit-level pass-through schedules; grant agreements.
