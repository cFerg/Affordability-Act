# Tariff Impacts on Housing/Vehicle Materials

## §17.1 Purpose
Neutralize **federal tariff** shocks on essential inputs (e.g., lumber, steel, transformers, glass) that would otherwise raise consumer prices under this Act.

## §17.2 Tariff Impact Offset (TIO) — State/Local
If a verified tariff increases the landed cost of an eligible input used in covered projects:
- The jurisdiction may grant a **Tariff Impact Offset** (rebate/credit) equal to the tariff burden actually paid, conditioned on full **pass-through** to the buyer/renter via a lower AV or capped price.
- Offsets **do not** raise AV; they **reduce** WIV (negative basis) to keep end prices flat.

## §17.3 Documentation & Sunset
Require supplier invoices showing tariff line items and dates. Offsets sunset automatically when the federal tariff is reduced/removed; any remaining reserves revert to the housing fund.

## §17.4 Federal Harmonization (Model Resolution)
Urge Congress/USITC to approve temporary duty-free treatment for designated critical housing components during shortages, with mandatory retail pass-through and clawbacks for non-compliance.

## §17.5 Audits
Random audits ≥10%. False claims → see §17.6

## §17.6 Enforcement
- **Prohibited:** Claiming TIO without pass-through; using offsets to raise AV.
- **Remedies:** Repayment with interest; treble damages for false claims; vendor debarment 3 years.
- **Records:** Supplier invoices showing tariff lines; pass-through workbook.
