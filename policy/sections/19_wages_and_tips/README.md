# Wage Baselines & Tipped Work (Affordability Link)

## §19.1 No Subminimum for Tipped Workers
Within the jurisdiction, the **cash wage** for tipped occupations must be at least the **full local minimum wage**. Tips are **extra** and may not offset base pay.

## §19.2 Service Charges vs Tips
If a fee is presented like a gratuity, 100% is distributed to service staff and **does not** count toward base wage obligations. If retained by the business, it must be labeled **“service fee (not a tip)”** on receipts and disclosure signage.

## §19.3 Pay Transparency & Method
Employers must provide line-item pay statements (base, tips, fees) and offer no-fee direct deposit (§7 Payment Integrity).

## §19.4 Wage Index Integrity
For the Act’s **Wage Index**, the labor department publishes median wages **reflecting full minimums without tip credits**. If federal/state datasets still include subminimums, the index is adjusted upward to neutralize tip-credit artifacts.

## §19.5 Enforcement
Back pay, double damages for willful violations, and license actions for repeat offenders. Retaliation prohibited.
