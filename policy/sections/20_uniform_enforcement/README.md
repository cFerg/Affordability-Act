# Uniform Enforcement, Remedies & Procedure

## §20.1 Applicability
Applies to all covered activities in §§1–19. Where a section has specific remedies, those add to (and do not limit) this section.

## §20.2 Core remedies
- **Restitution / rollback** of any unlawful overcharge, fee, or premium, plus **interest** (statutory) from date due.
- **Liquidated damages** = 1.0× the underpayment/overcharge (Policy Dial: 1.0–2.0×; 2.0× if willful/repeat).
- **Disgorgement** of ill-gotten gains for schemes involving concealment or repeat violations.
- **Fee-shifting:** prevailing complainant recovers reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.

## §20.3 Civil penalties (per incident unless stated)
| Tier | Conduct                         | Penalty (Policy Dial)         |
|------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| I    | Record/notice lapses (no harm)  | $100–$250                     |
| II   | Single overcharge/shortfall     | $250–$1,000                   |
| III  | Willful or repeat               | $1,000–$5,000                 |
| IV   | Systemic or deceptive scheme    | $5,000–$20,000 + disgorgement |

## §20.4 Records & transparency
Maintain relevant records **4 years** (or longer where specified): valuation files, offer logs, rent/O&M breakdowns, payroll/tip statements, invoices (tariffs), subsidy pass-throughs, insurance rate bases. Missing/inadequate records → **burden shifts** to respondent once complainant shows a plausible estimate.

## §20.5 Audits
Random audits ≥ **10%** annually (dial). Agencies may subpoena, inspect, and cross-check permits, payroll, banking, platform data. Whistleblower tips prioritized.

## §20.6 Procedure & timelines
- **Intake & notice** within 10 business days.
- **Cure window (optional)**: for non-willful first violations, 30 days to cure → civil penalties may be waived; **restitution, interest, and reporting still required**.
- **Valuation Review Board (VRB)**: targeted disputes (valuations, repairs). Hearing in ≤ 45 days; decision in ≤ 15 days; de novo admin appeal available.

## §20.7 Private right of action
Individuals or classes may sue for remedies in §20.2–§20.3 plus section-specific remedies. No mandatory arbitration or class waivers for covered disputes.

## §20.8 Anti-retaliation & whistleblowers
Any retaliation → separate Tier III penalty + make-whole relief. Verified whistleblowers may receive up to **10% of collected penalties** (dial).

## §20.9 Licensing & debarment
Repeat/willful violators may face license suspension/revocation (brokers, contractors, lenders, dealers, insurers) and **3-year debarment** from public programs or affiliations.

## §20.10 Coordination
Works alongside state consumer-protection, wage/hour, insurance, and housing laws. The greater remedy controls. Agencies may refer criminal fraud.

## §20.11 Limitations
Statute of limitations: **4 years** from discovery; tolled during concealment or missing records.
