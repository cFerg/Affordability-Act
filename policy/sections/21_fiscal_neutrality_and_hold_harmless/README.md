# 21 — Fiscal Neutrality & Hold-Harmless (Jobs, Taxes & Fees)

<!-- SUMMARY
Prevents employers and governments from offsetting affordability reforms by cutting pay, hours, or benefits, or by raising taxes/fees. Requires fiscal neutrality: savings and new revenues from the Act fund affordability, not general backfill. Strong anti-retaliation, anti-pass-through, and transparency rules ensure workers and residents don’t bear the cost.

## 21.1 Purpose
To ensure this Act improves affordability **without** shifting costs onto workers through reduced compensation or onto residents through increased taxes, fees, or utility rates.

## 21.2 Labor Hold-Harmless (No Wage/Hours Backfill)
### a) No Offset via Compensation
Employers shall not reduce base pay, scheduled hours, employer-paid benefits, or paid leave to offset compliance with any provision of this Act.
### b) Presumption of Retaliation
A reduction in any item in 21.2(a) within **180 days** of a covered compliance event creates a rebuttable presumption of unlawful retaliation.
### c) Remedies
Make-whole relief (back pay, benefit restoration), **double damages** for willful violations, attorneys’ fees, and injunctive relief.
### d) Recordkeeping
Employers must retain 24 months of payroll, scheduling, and benefit records; failure to produce creates an adverse inference.

## 21.3 Tax & Fee Neutrality (No Backdoor Increases)
### a) No Net New Tax Burden
State or local governments shall not increase ad valorem tax rates, create new surcharges, or raise general fees **for the purpose of** offsetting revenue changes caused by this Act.
### b) Utility/Service Rates
Public utilities and municipal services may not raise rates or add riders to backfill Act-related revenue changes.
### c) Certification
Any proposed tax/fee/rate action within **24 months** of the Act’s effective date must include a **Fiscal Neutrality Certification** affirming it is not intended to offset this Act and disclosing actuarial basis and alternatives considered.

## 21.4 Prohibited Pass-Throughs
### a) Line-Item Evasion
Parties may not relabel price elements (e.g., “processing,” “compliance,” “market adjustment”) to exceed RACV + permissible variance caps or to bypass rent/formula ceilings.
### b) Contracts
Clauses purporting to pass through Act-related costs to workers/tenants/buyers are **void and unenforceable**.

## 21.5 Affordability Transition Fund (ATF)
### a) Use of Proceeds
Revenues from this Act (vacancy duties, enforcement penalties, rezoning value-capture, clawbacks, tariff rebates tied to affordability, documented junk-fee refunds) are deposited into an **Affordability Transition Fund**.
### b) Eligible Uses
(i) One-time admin/setup; (ii) targeted assistance for negative-equity edge cases; (iii) rehab grants/loans that **reduce** RACV; (iv) tech & audit infrastructure; (v) public reporting/dashboards.
### c) Prohibited Uses
ATF may not fund general operations, pensions, or unrelated capital projects.
### d) Sunset Review
ATF uses are reviewed every **3 years**, with automatic rate reductions/duty sunsets if collections exceed documented needs.

## 21.6 Maintenance of Effort (MOE)
### a) No Service Cuts to Backfill
Jurisdictions shall maintain baseline service levels in housing inspection, appeals, and courts; they may not degrade services to coerce higher revenue.
### b) State Aid Stabilizer (Optional)
States may provide temporary, formula-based stabilization grants to localities with verified transitional dips, funded **only** from ATF sources.

## 21.7 Transparency & Audits
### a) Annual Fiscal Impact Report
Publishes: (i) ATF inflows/outflows; (ii) any tax/fee/rate changes certified under 21.3(c); (iii) wage/hour trends by sector; (iv) enforcement outcomes.
### b) Independent Audit
Biennial audit of neutrality compliance; findings trigger corrective actions and public hearings.
### c) Whistleblower Protections
Retaliation for reporting neutrality violations is prohibited; bounties allowed for material recoveries.

## 21.8 Enforcement & Remedies
### a) Private Right of Action
Workers, tenants, and buyers may sue for violations of 21.2–21.4 with fee-shifting.
### b) Public Enforcement
Attorney General/local counsel may seek civil penalties, disgorgement to the ATF, and injunctive relief.
### c) Escalators for Willfulness
Penalties increase for repeated or coordinated evasion schemes (e.g., sham fees, systematic wage offsets).

## 21.9 Anti-Circumvention
Any arrangement—direct or indirect—intended to evade fiscal neutrality or hold-harmless provisions shall be deemed a violation of this Section.
